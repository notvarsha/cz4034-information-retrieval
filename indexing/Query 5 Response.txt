So my only condition is that I don't want to invest time on doing market and fundamental research again and again on regular basis, but I will surely do the research initially before buying the token. I want that I just put the money once and try my luck after some years. That's all. I understand my strategy sounds like little lazy but I am sure some people might do like this too.

Can anyone give me some great advice on this like when should I start investing and how can I do my initial research on selecting good cryptos. Should I trust the new or upcoming tokens or should I go with the already settled ones? Thanks in advance!"],

Emailed the operator and he called me back and resolved the issue in 10m. Please note : Network issues might need the machine to be restarted. Happened once. Took 10-30 seconds to start operating. Invested Received 1. ₹21,000 ~ ₹17,947 2. ₹5,000 ~ ₹4,249 3. ₹10,000 ~ ₹8,538 Total ₹36,000 What i got : ₹30,734 $66,400 is a lot in my opinion. That's nearly the All time high. Overall not cost beneficial for me. Hopefully this post helps you make an informed decision :)"],

        "PostContent":["**General advice (Ctrl+F to search for your scam)** As a rule of thumb: If you're doubting whether the site is a scam, it probably is. Our advice is to withdraw your money from the scam site if possible, transfer your money out of the wallet, cut contact, and contact law enforcement. If you confront the scammers about being unable to withdraw the money, they may guilt trip you into paying more [fees](https://sites.google.com/view/scammerce/scams/advance-fee) to do that, for example asking for money to pay \"taxes\" and offering to cover a part of your expenses. If you manage to withdraw your money from the scam site, transferring it out of your compromised cryptocurrency wallet ensures that it is now out of reach of the scammers. Report the scammers to the platform and block them, but do not delete chat logs. The evidence has to be preserved for law enforcement. Law enforcement is often not qualified or motivated to recover your money, but if you are unable to get your money back, they are your only option. Even if they do not help you in the end, reporting the scam will at least alert them to the problem, keeping it on the radar. Unfortunately, no hacker online can get back what you've lost. Please watch out for [recovery scams](https://sites.google.com/view/scammerce/scams/recovery), a follow-up scam done after victims have fallen for an earlier scam. Scammers will DM you to offer recovery services. A form of the advance-fee, victims are convinced that the scammer can recover their money. This \"help\" can come in the form of fake hacking services or authorities. If you see anyone circumventing the scam filters, please report the submission and we will take action shortly. &#x200B; **Collecting information** * Please do not post personally identifiable information. * Photos the scammer sends are not usually considered useful information for tracking. If you can get them to video call though, that may help more. * IP addresses can serve as a rough gauge of location, especially when a lot of data is collected. &#x200B; **Scambaiting** Here are some [resources](https://sites.google.com/view/scammerce/scambaiting/resources) to help.

The name of the website is linzhiphoenix.io and they claim to be the official website of the of the company manufacturing the Linzhi Phoenix. At the time they really looked official and I gathered some money from friends and what I had put aside and acted based on my emotions. The transfer was with BTC, I never really had any suspicion about them. On the website it said 2 days processing time. After the third day with no confirmation of shipping I decided to contact them again. They made up some excuse for \"delaying\" the shipping and asked for some understanding. I started to worry, all my friends were telling me that it is a scam. I didn't want to believe. The next week they were already hiding and not replying.... I don't know what to do and where to turn.... I know it is my responsibility to protect my coins, but still these scammers need to be punished."],

[https://twitter.com/fakewebbuster/status/1514931414827147264?s=20&t=6uIUcyTQY50zwcg1skiyxA](https://twitter.com/fakewebbuster/status/1514931414827147264?s=20&t=6uIUcyTQY50zwcg1skiyxA) &#x200B; All the domains point to the same website just with a fake name. Here is a (just as fake as all the rest) example. &#x200B; [The Wuppertal Scammer Strikes again vamxbit.com](https://preview.redd.it/4gq45n51ucs81.png?width=3410&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a47024a444b0991f4aafc46f9dd35b10517693f) &#x200B; **Telegram Update**: Looks like the scammers have franchised their idea. They now are on Telegram too. Called Top Pumps see pic. Of course only works with their fraud, scam website. &#x200B; &#x200B; [scam 24coinfex.com promoted by Top Pumps ](https://preview.redd.it/mecx9z7hd0i91.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=d83851ad219782c6bc50d282c2bcc670190595b8) &#x200B; &#x200B; You have all heard of the pump and dump groups where the organizers of the group buy a token in advance and then tell the group just before its time to pump which token to buy to push up the price. The organizers of course are selling at a profit to the rest of the group. Welcome to Pump and Dumps 2.0 where the pump and dump is legit (kinda) they will tell you in advance which token is the target (like 24 hours) and then on the signal the token goes up 200 to 300% and you can make that in profits in your trades. As always if it is too good to be true it generally is. The scam is genius, it is the Exchange. The pump and dump group says you must use a certain exchange and on the signal I imagine the exchange just raises the price so you can sell at the profit. There are probably a number of discord servers. They have people discussing things and posting as often as possible withdrawal images. If you look at the public address they post most are fake or have zero balances; Here are a few they post TK525raNGQi4ixBT4oxM2wdzYAxPNGnXve 0xda33b60be42acc33cef1597b95cb71d08f346557 1N3BH4Cw5yei1k6UW2VXF7RZ6uqvSETbNd KL545vqEACo2toa8M5ezV4pejHGgSDIZWcx 0xba66b50be24acc22cef5183b56cb50d78f395457 TR626arNGwn4in7T4oxM7wszYAxPKDvXBv &#x200B; You will see post all the time from fake people like this. The address OP893arNGQi3ixfhR3nM7wdzYAxPKDkIEp does not exist. A clear sign it is a scam is when you go to withdraw. You will be asked to \"deposit\" more crypto to verify yourself. See the below image. &#x200B; [Verify with a Deposit :-\\) 24coinfex.com - vamxbit.com](https://preview.redd.it/v0qat0zjpen81.jpg?width=564&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=26c195405f2cd88746ff0d6678a28523ba79cf30) &#x200B; &#x200B; Andrei Melkov changes the domain often once word gets out. I have highlighted his contact details, if you want a cheap domain name contact him. Digital Ocean (See all the red boxes) has been put on notice numerous times of this scam but as can bee seen from the below image allow it to continue with the same domain name owner and identical content. Maybe a good lawyer might get your full losses out of them given they knew about it but did nothing. Further Serverius also has. Not only do they both ignore this scam being run on their servers but given the address of the owner of the name currently support a country that is on numerous sanction lists. &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; No you are not seeing double. With a simple text search of the HTML Andrei changes the website to match the domain. &#x200B; &#x200B; [The LOOOOONG list of domains 24coinfex.com vamxbit.com](https://preview.redd.it/u7207lc1v9b91.png?width=3300&format=png&auto=webp&s=7508c63a3316342713bcab7a728c6e48492fffa0) [All sites are identical vamxbit.com 24coinfex.com](https://preview.redd.it/wugd1nyxu9b91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=749f73830722943ca3e18d1a13337d3dc9486b0b) &#x200B; &#x200B; And don't trust any of the reviews online either, they have that covered. On Trust pilot they have multiple reviews for Trezbit already. Here is my favourite - the domain is 7 days old but this person has been using it for over 6 months. (EDIT: NOW REMOVED) &#x200B; [TrustPilot 6 Month? Not even 6 days.](https://preview.redd.it/mr3650yejen81.jpg?width=1510&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c349dc111930c11af5d742d290d7ee8237a1053f) EDIT: Despite being alerted to the fake exchange TrustPilot still has positive comments which are obvious fakes. Here is one which indicates they withdrew to a UK bank account. The writer who is from SK (Slovakia) has a UK bank account, however, that could be possible. The problem is that Bitswet and Trezbit never have and obviously never will have on and off ramps to real bank accounts :-) &#x200B; [The Fake Continues on Trust Pilot](https://preview.redd.it/gih5e3pkjen81.jpg?width=1378&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c697df981b7ee649fef68dd02a2c893812bd6762) &#x200B; It is also good to see the scammer spending most of his time writing reviews. Keep him busy with Trust Pilot - who promotes these fake sites and is not interested in the truth or scams in my opinion. &#x200B; [Andrei and Co. Fake Reviews ](https://preview.redd.it/k37e7vb6ken81.png?width=1394&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac997740ba5ceb13d07e981af44a507d1de416fa) &#x200B; If you cannot trust reviews what can you trust?

However, recently, even my tech-savvy software engineer friends and co-workers have been talking about NFTs and the metaverse. I'd like to know if I'm misunderstanding NFTs or if NFT holders are misunderstanding NFTs. For context: I'm a senior software engineer at one of the big 4, a significant portion of my net worth is in crypto, and I've spent several months writing crypto algo trading bots in 2017/18. From a technological standpoint, do the current NFTs have any value, aside from selling to a greater fool? Obviously, they're mostly just links to images, so they're still controlled by whoever's hosting the images. Even if the images were embedded directly in the blockchain, I still don't see how they're useful because of the following reasons: 1. There's no uniqueness enforced: 2 people can mint the same image as NFTs 2. NFTs are useless for IP laws: in the eyes of the law, owning an NFT doesn't mean you own whatever's in it. Some NFTs have legal writings attached, but as far as I can tell, that's pretty rare 3. With regards to the metaverse, it's up to whoever owns the metaverse implementation to decide whether to incorporate blockchain data. E.g. in Facebook/Apple/Microsoft's metaverses, I think they'd prefer having centralized control of ownership of virtual goods, they'd likely ignore the current NFTs Let me know if I got any of this wrong! In my opinion, other ways to use NFTs could still be valuable. One use-case that I'm very excited for is permanent ownership of video game assets. It's common for people to spend a lot of time or money in a video game, then they move on to another game. If my in-game currency, characters, and items could exist on the blockchain, then they could be transferred to another game or sold to other players. I think this would be especially useful for trading card games (e.g. MTG, Yugioh, Pokemon), where people can buy cards through a smart contract and load their cards into any client to play with other people. Most clients would only allow cards minted by the official smart contract. Through a DAO, new cards can be added and banlists can be maintained.

        "PostContent":["(originally posted as a Medium article and on r/cc, hoping for some better discussion here) Staking is one of the more recent buzzwords in crypto. It allows you to earn \"passive income\". Different chains offer different implementations of staking. Some make staking very easy, some have high returns on staking, and in all cases you supposedly help secure the network. In this post, I explain why if you are invested in a Proof of Stake crypto you might want to dig deeper into your choice as all might not be as rosy as it seems. # Pointless staking yield What makes most people enthusiastic about staking is that by staking, you earn more tokens as a reward. You make money, without doing anything! These tokens have to come from somewhere. In most projects, staking rewards come primarily from supply inflation. You might receive a 6% yield on your tokens, which seems fantastic until you realise that the supply is also expanding at 6% per year. In other words — in this case you're not actually gaining anything. When you hold 100 tokens out of a total of 1000 and get 6 extra tokens at the end of a year, you're not gaining when the total supply has increased to 1060. In both cases, you hold 10% of the supply. This is what I would call pointless staking in its most extreme form. Not all staking cryptos pay for the yield purely by increasing the supply. This brings us to the next aspect of staking. #Redistribution through staking When staking isn't as simple as everyone gaining an equal percentage, there inherently has to be some redistribution. It might be that you gain 7%, while supply only increases by 6%. This is only possible if not everyone gains 7%. How is this possible? There are two options, broadly speaking: 1. Yield consists of a combination of inflation and fees paid or; 1. Yield is paid from block rewards increasing supply, but supply is at the same time decreased through burning transaction fees. The first option is the most basic and oldest form of staking, and is most comparable to Proof of Work. In Proof of Work, you gain a block subsidy for mining a block, and you get the fees paid for the transactions in the block. The same holds true in staking. Stakers are paid (a percentage of) the block reward and fees paid for transactions. The 7% staking reward you get might therefore come from increased supply (6%) and from fees paid (1%). The second option is an option that tries to hide the centralization over time by not having fees accrue to stakers but rather having them burnt. This means that the fees are sent to a burn account, that cannot be accessed. As an example, stakers might get a 7% staking reward, which consists of 5% block rewards, and a 2% decrease in supply due to fees being burnt. While good for you as a staker, there is an obvious downside to both options. # Discouragement of using the crypto If you pay fees to use the chain, while getting staking rewards for not using the chain, there is a clear disconnect. Those using the chain will hold less and less of the supply, while those staking hold an ever larger share of the supply. While you as a staker would be happy with the yield you are getting, users would clearly be happier if they could pay lower fees, and might look to cheaper and more efficient solutions. Perhaps those staking also have an interest in using the network sporadically. In this case, staking still leads to centralization over time. Fees are denoted in absolute terms (say 0.1 XYZ), rather than relative to your holdings. If small and big holders both transact, the small holder is paying a far larger percentage of his holdings in fees than the large holder is. In a scenario where small holders hold 1 XYZ, large holders hold 1000 XYZ, and transaction fees are 0.1 XYZ, a single transaction costs a painful 10% of the holdings of the small holder, while the large holder would barely feel the 0.0001% fee. Double discouragement through lock-up periods It potentially gets even worse. Many staking cryptocurrencies force you to lock up your crypto to receive staking rewards. This is the model ETH2 is using as well. When you lock up your tokens, you can't use them until after the lock-up period. As a small holder, you might be okay locking up some of your tokens (longer-term savings), but you also need some tokens for usage. A large holder might also want to use some of their tokens occasionally, but can lock up a far larger percentage. We see this in traditional finance — the richer you are, the larger the percentage of your net worth that is invested rather than in cash. Because of this, while you might get just 5% on your total holdings as you keep some funds available to use, large holders might be getting 6.9% as they are able to lock up almost all their tokens. Further centralization through staking pools Taking ETH2 as an example again, setting up a staking pool is not cheap. ETH requires 32 ETH staked (~$100k) to participate in validation. If you don't have 32 ETH, which many of us do not, you have to join a pool to stake. Pools charge fees for this, either a fixed fee per month or a percentage (10–25%). This fee once again accrues to larger holders. In other chains such as Cardano setting up a stake pool is far cheaper. Regardless, the same holds true. There are costs to set up a stake pool, and there are fees associated with joining a stake pool. Those with large holdings become ever larger, while small holders hold relatively less and less. #Summarizing the futility of staking Proof of Stake has two possible results. Either everyone stakes, no redistribution happens, and nothing is gained for anyone through staking. The other option is that not everyone is rewarded equally for staking, causing redistribution. This redistribution inevitably accrues to the largest holders, causing centralization of consensus power and supply over time. Because of this, I believe that Proof of Stake makes small holders relatively poorer, rather than richer. At the same time, staking decreases decentralization & security, therefore decreasing the value of the protocol as a whole. For those interested, I've written about methods to avoid [centralization over time](https://senatus.substack.com/p/why-99-of-cryptocurrencies-centralize). I've also [written about Nano](https://senatus.substack.com/p/the-basics-of-nano-why-its-such-an), a cryptocurrency that has 0% inflation, 0 fees, and that remains decentralized and secure over time.

You make money, without doing anything! These tokens have to come from somewhere. In most projects, staking rewards come primarily from supply inflation. You might receive a 6% yield on your tokens, which seems fantastic until you realise that the supply is also expanding at 6% per year. In other words — in this case you're not actually gaining anything. When you hold 100 tokens out of a total of 1000 and get 6 extra tokens at the end of a year, you're not gaining when the total supply has increased to 1060. In both cases, you hold 10% of the supply. This is what I would call pointless staking in its most extreme form. Not all staking cryptos pay for the yield purely by increasing the supply. This brings us to the next aspect of staking. #Redistribution through staking When staking isn't as simple as everyone gaining an equal percentage, there inherently has to be some redistribution. It might be that you gain 7%, while supply only increases by 6%. This is only possible if not everyone gains 7%. How is this possible? There are two options, broadly speaking: 1. Yield consists of a combination of inflation and fees paid or; 1. Yield is paid from block rewards increasing supply, but supply is at the same time decreased through burning transaction fees. The first option is the most basic and oldest form of staking, and is most comparable to Proof of Work. In Proof of Work, you gain a block subsidy for mining a block, and you get the fees paid for the transactions in the block. The same holds true in staking. Stakers are paid (a percentage of) the block reward and fees paid for transactions. The 7% staking reward you get might therefore come from increased supply (6%) and from fees paid (1%). The second option is an option that tries to hide the centralization over time by not having fees accrue to stakers but rather having them burnt. This means that the fees are sent to a burn account, that cannot be accessed. As an example, stakers might get a 7% staking reward, which consists of 5% block rewards, and a 2% decrease in supply due to fees being burnt. While good for you as a staker, there is an obvious downside to both options. # Discouragement of using the crypto If you pay fees to use the chain, while getting staking rewards for not using the chain, there is a clear disconnect. Those using the chain will hold less and less of the supply, while those staking hold an ever larger share of the supply. While you as a staker would be happy with the yield you are getting, users would clearly be happier if they could pay lower fees, and might look to cheaper and more efficient solutions. Perhaps those staking also have an interest in using the network sporadically. In this case, staking still leads to centralization over time. Fees are denoted in absolute terms (say 0.1 XYZ), rather than relative to your holdings. If small and big holders both transact, the small holder is paying a far larger percentage of his holdings in fees than the large holder is. In a scenario where small holders hold 1 XYZ, large holders hold 1000 XYZ, and transaction fees are 0.1 XYZ, a single transaction costs a painful 10% of the holdings of the small holder, while the large holder would barely feel the 0.0001% fee. Double discouragement through lock-up periods It potentially gets even worse. Many staking cryptocurrencies force you to lock up your crypto to receive staking rewards. This is the model ETH2 is using as well. When you lock up your tokens, you can't use them until after the lock-up period. As a small holder, you might be okay locking up some of your tokens (longer-term savings), but you also need some tokens for usage. A large holder might also want to use some of their tokens occasionally, but can lock up a far larger percentage. We see this in traditional finance — the richer you are, the larger the percentage of your net worth that is invested rather than in cash. Because of this, while you might get just 5% on your total holdings as you keep some funds available to use, large holders might be getting 6.9% as they are able to lock up almost all their tokens. Further centralization through staking pools Taking ETH2 as an example again, setting up a staking pool is not cheap. ETH requires 32 ETH staked (~$100k) to participate in validation. If you don't have 32 ETH, which many of us do not, you have to join a pool to stake. Pools charge fees for this, either a fixed fee per month or a percentage (10–25%). This fee once again accrues to larger holders. In other chains such as Cardano setting up a stake pool is far cheaper. Regardless, the same holds true. There are costs to set up a stake pool, and there are fees associated with joining a stake pool. Those with large holdings become ever larger, while small holders hold relatively less and less. #Summarizing the futility of staking Proof of Stake has two possible results. Either everyone stakes, no redistribution happens, and nothing is gained for anyone through staking. The other option is that not everyone is rewarded equally for staking, causing redistribution. This redistribution inevitably accrues to the largest holders, causing centralization of consensus power and supply over time. Because of this, I believe that Proof of Stake makes small holders relatively poorer, rather than richer. At the same time, staking decreases decentralization & security, therefore decreasing the value of the protocol as a whole. For those interested, I've written about methods to avoid [centralization over time](https://senatus.substack.com/p/why-99-of-cryptocurrencies-centralize). I've also [written about Nano](https://senatus.substack.com/p/the-basics-of-nano-why-its-such-an), a cryptocurrency that has 0% inflation, 0 fees, and that remains decentralized and secure over time.

        "PostContent":["Hello, I am writing this to inform everyone about a SCAM website called justminer.net! This website recently scammed me for about $3500 in crypto (BTC). When I contacted them they responded almost immediately and they were very nice and polite! I chose the miners and they even offered me a discount for the order, which was very tempting and I was ready to buy from them. This is when their trap clicked around my foot! They have sent me a proper-looking invoice, which I paid the same day! Now I truly regret my decision to order from them, but at the moment I didn't know that they were scammers! So, the payment was made, the deal was finalized and I relaxed, until the 4th day after this, because I got a little suspicious, why I haven't received a confirmation and tracking number for my order until now. I wrote them an email - no response, tried to call them - no response, wrote on the contact form - no response! I waited two more days and wrote every day but there was still no answer! Then I realized that I have been scammed by these thieves from justminer.net! It has been more than 17 days since this happen and there is still silence from their side! I am warning you to not order and to not be as greedy as me, because it will cost you more than you think. Justminer.net is nothing more than a BIG SCAM"],

It plans on creating a dApp that connects to our houses and takes care of every small detail from ordering food to setting lighting depending on my mood (kind of like an Alexa dApp). At least I'm glad this this company is getting the recognition it deserves. They're aiming to get a slot in the upcoming Kusama parachain auction. And so far it's looking like they're doing well.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders.

Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders.

If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes.

Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid.

Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents.

Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries.

Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment.

Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time.

As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work?

Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries.

Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already.

Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues.

( yes , this creates its challenges , but still solvable ones ) . really interesting one ! significant other first off i 'd say that 0.17 ada at $ 1.45 per ada is quite high already , no ? second off , that makes me wonder how they do spam resistance/prioritization . what if throughput gets filled ? > a final note on that , cardano 's decentralization is very slowly increasing , not decreasing . i think this is hard to measure , right ? the same goes for nano , just to be clear , but i 'd say that in cardano there is perhaps even more incentive to try to `` hide '' centralization as ( last i was told ) larger pools get a smaller reward . significant other there is a clear incentive to try to split up your stake , right ? > my only criticism is about nano 's sustainability . since it 's feeless , and some nodes has ever increasing demands , how do you sustain it over the longer term ? yup , that can definitely be a worry . the general thinking behind it is that full nodes will increasingly be run by businesses . that 's what we 're seeing happen right now as well , for what it 's worth . nodes are currently roughly $ 20 or significant other per month , but it 's easy to imagine that that cost will increase ten+fold if usage far increases . the thing is that usage would be increasing due to more adoption of nano , which also means it is worth it for more people/businesses to run nano nodes . when we look at how much binance and kraken make off of fees for nano trading , for example , nodes getting a fair bit more expensive would be no problem . when we look at businesses like 465 di and kappture , more expensive nodes would not be an issue for them . same holds for many larger holders , and other businesses . it does mean that running full nodes for individuals will probably become rarer . they might run pruned nodes , or we might see improvements in other ways to keep it possible to run nodes as a `` regular '' person . someone recently came up with a way to trustlessly [ use the network with just 2 mb storage for example ] ( https : //np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/n9dgfh/lightweight_nano_node_with_a_ledger_under_2_mb/ ) ."],

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents.

In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work?

Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives.

Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work?

Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners.

These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes.

Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\").

Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time.

As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work?

An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time.

If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool.

Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already.

        "PostContent":["Tl;dr My thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. An expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. Very few crypto, amongst which Nano, are likely to stay secure over time. This post is not meant as a Nano shill post, but one of the reasons I got into Nano is that I believe it solves these issues. Feel free to comment solely about the PoW/PoS centralizing thesis. # Zooming in on Bitcoin's incentive structure Bitcoin mining offers rewards. These rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 BTC per block) and fees ([\\~0.5 BTC per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. Bitcoin mining is a business. A big one, with daily revenue of[ \\~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). It's a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (Bitcoin's price) is largely unchangeable by Bitcoin miners. Miners' total costs consist of energy costs, ASIC purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. Almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. A larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for ASICs. They have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. They have access to cheaper capital. They can more efficiently maintain their ASICs. Combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. The largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in ASICs, and increase their share of consensus over time. This isn't some radical, unsupported take. The theory is quite clear for more sectors than just Bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. Research on specifically Bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **FUD, China is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have Stratum V2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don't see 80% belonging to one miner now!** None of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. It doesn't change the economic rationale. China banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. Stratum doesn't fix the incentives. Miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won't fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. Not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see \"[A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf)\"). Nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. If I owned a majority of mining power, I wouldn't shout it off the rooftops. I would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to \"overbid me\" to process their transaction. Unbelievable? See [Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. Those invested in PoW-based coins other than Bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. Maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. The incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with PoW consensus. Bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other PoW coins. Perhaps you're invested in a PoS coin. [Mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? While PoS has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to PoW, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. The largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. A large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. The higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. Most staking is done using pools. Setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. As an example, Ethereum requires 32 ETH staked (\\~$60,000) to participate in validation. If you do not have 32 ETH, you have to join a pool to stake. These pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). This fee again goes to larger holders. Finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. When you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. Some PoS cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase Bitcoin's decentralization by splitting AntPool into Ant and Pool. Nothing has changed. If anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # A possible solution to the centralization issue The common thread in both PoS and PoW is that there are monetary rewards. These rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. Monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. The simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. Remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. While this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make Bitcoin and other PoW/PoS coins insecure. Miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. Hashrate would drop, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their ASICs back on. However, the cryptocurrency space does not end at Bitcoin. Nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. With zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. Without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. The challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. Nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. So how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? Instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. For trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \\~$20 a month). For exchanges to be able to confirm that the Nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. They run their own node. Large Nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. This theory has played out well for over five years already. Exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin run nodes. Nano wallets, such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/), [WeNano](https://wenano.net/) and Atomic Wallet run nodes. Businesses building on the Nano network such as [Wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [Kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465DI](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. Hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. Through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in Nano. Validators are not all treated equally. If 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. Nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. Just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any Nano holder can use their Nano to vote for any node. Votes can be changed at any time. To get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. Simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. You need to have Nano voting weight, where 1 Nano = 1 vote. On the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. Without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. As a Nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. Doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. Nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # Does it work? Nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. Without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. In that time, over the course of \\~120 million transactions, Nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can't say. Over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. Without mining and without staking in Nano, centralization over time is absent from Nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *Thank you for reading, I'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in PoW/PoS coins and what you think about the solution that Nano presents. I see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so I'd love feedback on this.* &#x200B; 1.

Decentralization The first, standardization, simply means that instead of building these platforms completely from scratch, which is a massive technological undertaking, we can use existing crypto/smart contract SDKs to create a basic network within minutes. This is huge, as it greatly reduces software development costs, which in turn increases competition. The second, decentralization, means that we dont have a single source of failure. If Youtube as a company is fined or they make bad business decisions, everything the creators have built vanishes along with them. Also, the network can vote and reach consensus on what is best for the network as opposed to only the shareholders. This helps a lot against corruption in general. With this we are forced to bake trustless transparency into our important software platforms. It bothers me that people are mostly interested in the financial aspect of crypto. I understand we are very early and still building out the Interchain infrastructure, but please stop trying to turn crypto into the stock market v2.0 Sorry for the long post, im curious to hear your thoughts! I could go on but i need to work lol Tldr; Crypto is a paradigm shift in software applications allowing the standardization and decentralizion of big tech (easily corruptible) platforms that directly rewards value contributors while minimizing middlemen"],

        "PostContent":[" Over the past month or so, analysts have consistently called [Beyond Protocol](http://beyond.link/) the next top three coin. Examples include [Crypto Rick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U4Dk-rGRkc), [Satoshi Sean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH1N6KWSShA), and [KIFS Crypto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLHgVep3tcI). Although a lot to consider, I generally agreed. This is a team from Stanford, IBM, Cisco, Amazon buoyed by Hollywood execs (it shows in their insane marketing; check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1txFf7Cv8K8) overview video). They are solving a big problem: devices in the future will need to pay each other digitally. The Gartners of the world have said there will be more transactions between devices than humans. Then I watched an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCt0R3N9uC4) with the CEO Jonathan Manzi and Tijo Bear. It's long -- 38 minutes. While I was watching it, it dawned on me that Beyond Protocol will be bigger than Bitcoin. Devices don't need just to be able to pay each other, they need to be made secure so they can open up to the world. The world can then develop on top of them. Beyond Protocol has built a frictionless technology which can be adopted with one line of code which makes spoofing -- the biggest pain point in cybersecurity right now -- probabilistically impossible. They do this by leveraging hardware signatures and distributed ledgers. Manzi explains it in less than 45s in [this](https://twitter.com/FlameCryptos/status/1404846333861765122) video tweet (watch it, everything will click!) What Beyond Protocol has built does two critical things. First, it makes devices secure for the first time. Now secure, they can open up. And now developers can build applications on top which unite them. Just from a smartphone, Apple's App Store brought us applications which changed the way we live: Uber, Instacart, etc. Beyond Protocol's Mega App Store will allow developers to build apps on not just an iPhone, but literally every device in the universe. Second, it allows devices to pay each other. And the \"pay each other\" part can get really nuts quickly. It can be autonomous vehicles paying each other for priority in a traffic grid. Or, it can be simply microtransactions which represent the amount of energy expended for a secure message to be sent between devices. Beyond Protocol is literally building the new Internet for devices. They are doing what the biggest companies in the world have tried to do in business consortia over the past decade but failed due to the battle of egos that always goes on -- one company trying to gain dominance over others. Beyond Protocol is opening a can of whoop-ass on all that. They're going all open-source protocol, just like ARPA when the internet was started, and they will win. Don't bet against an idea which time has come. I am a proud member of their Street Team by the way. I will do my best to answer any questions you might have.

To date, Beyond has sold 4.96% of its token supply to project backers and allocated 6.07% to advisers. Beyond last sold its tokens in a private sale with a market capitalization of $100,000,000.00. *Q: How can I buy Beyond tokens?* A: We have sold tokens to-date in a private pre-sale to parties which we believe can help advance our project as partners. For inquiries related to this, kindly see the pinned post in our Telegram group.

We plan to unveil key partnerships in Q3 2021 ahead of a token generation event (TGE). *Q: Who are your key advisors?* A: Some of our advisors include: * Anoop Nannra (Global Blockchain Practice Leader at Amazon; Formerly: Global Head of Blockchain, Cisco) * Stephen DiFranco (Former SVP/GM IoT, Broadcom) * Brian Forde (Sr. White House Advisor to Obama; Co-Founder Digital Media Initiative, MIT Media Lab) * Greg Silverman (Co-Founder/CEO of Stampede Ventures; Formerly: President, Warner Bros) * Brian Weinstein (President/COO, Bad Robot) * Peter Boni (Managing Principal, Kedgeway)"],

        "PostContent":[" Over the past month or so, analysts have consistently called [Beyond Protocol](http://beyond.link/) the next top three coin. Examples include [Crypto Rick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U4Dk-rGRkc), [Satoshi Sean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH1N6KWSShA), and [KIFS Crypto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLHgVep3tcI). Although a lot to consider, I generally agreed. This is a team from Stanford, IBM, Cisco, Amazon buoyed by Hollywood execs (it shows in their insane marketing; check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1txFf7Cv8K8) overview video). They are solving a big problem: devices in the future will need to pay each other digitally. The Gartners of the world have said there will be more transactions between devices than humans. Then I watched an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCt0R3N9uC4) with the CEO Jonathan Manzi and Tijo Bear. It's long -- 38 minutes. While I was watching it, it dawned on me that Beyond Protocol will be bigger than Bitcoin. Devices don't need just to be able to pay each other, they need to be made secure so they can open up to the world. The world can then develop on top of them. Beyond Protocol has built a frictionless technology which can be adopted with one line of code which makes spoofing -- the biggest pain point in cybersecurity right now -- probabilistically impossible. They do this by leveraging hardware signatures and distributed ledgers. Manzi explains it in less than 45s in [this](https://twitter.com/FlameCryptos/status/1404846333861765122) video tweet (watch it, everything will click!) What Beyond Protocol has built does two critical things. First, it makes devices secure for the first time. Now secure, they can open up. And now developers can build applications on top which unite them. Just from a smartphone, Apple's App Store brought us applications which changed the way we live: Uber, Instacart, etc. Beyond Protocol's Mega App Store will allow developers to build apps on not just an iPhone, but literally every device in the universe. Second, it allows devices to pay each other. And the \"pay each other\" part can get really nuts quickly. It can be autonomous vehicles paying each other for priority in a traffic grid. Or, it can be simply microtransactions which represent the amount of energy expended for a secure message to be sent between devices. Beyond Protocol is literally building the new Internet for devices. They are doing what the biggest companies in the world have tried to do in business consortia over the past decade but failed due to the battle of egos that always goes on -- one company trying to gain dominance over others. Beyond Protocol is opening a can of whoop-ass on all that. They're going all open-source protocol, just like ARPA when the internet was started, and they will win.

        "PostContent":[" Over the past month or so, analysts have consistently called [Beyond Protocol](http://beyond.link/) the next top three coin. Examples include [Crypto Rick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U4Dk-rGRkc), [Satoshi Sean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH1N6KWSShA), and [KIFS Crypto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLHgVep3tcI). Although a lot to consider, I generally agreed. This is a team from Stanford, IBM, Cisco, Amazon buoyed by Hollywood execs (it shows in their insane marketing; check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1txFf7Cv8K8) overview video). They are solving a big problem: devices in the future will need to pay each other digitally. The Gartners of the world have said there will be more transactions between devices than humans. Then I watched an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCt0R3N9uC4) with the CEO Jonathan Manzi and Tijo Bear. It's long -- 38 minutes. While I was watching it, it dawned on me that Beyond Protocol will be bigger than Bitcoin. Devices don't need just to be able to pay each other, they need to be made secure so they can open up to the world. The world can then develop on top of them. Beyond Protocol has built a frictionless technology which can be adopted with one line of code which makes spoofing -- the biggest pain point in cybersecurity right now -- probabilistically impossible. They do this by leveraging hardware signatures and distributed ledgers. Manzi explains it in less than 45s in [this](https://twitter.com/FlameCryptos/status/1404846333861765122) video tweet (watch it, everything will click!) What Beyond Protocol has built does two critical things. First, it makes devices secure for the first time. Now secure, they can open up. And now developers can build applications on top which unite them. Just from a smartphone, Apple's App Store brought us applications which changed the way we live: Uber, Instacart, etc. Beyond Protocol's Mega App Store will allow developers to build apps on not just an iPhone, but literally every device in the universe. Second, it allows devices to pay each other. And the \"pay each other\" part can get really nuts quickly. It can be autonomous vehicles paying each other for priority in a traffic grid. Or, it can be simply microtransactions which represent the amount of energy expended for a secure message to be sent between devices. Beyond Protocol is literally building the new Internet for devices. They are doing what the biggest companies in the world have tried to do in business consortia over the past decade but failed due to the battle of egos that always goes on -- one company trying to gain dominance over others. Beyond Protocol is opening a can of whoop-ass on all that. They're going all open-source protocol, just like ARPA when the internet was started, and they will win. Don't bet against an idea which time has come. I am a proud member of their Street Team by the way. I will do my best to answer any questions you might have.

        "PostContent":[" Over the past month or so, analysts have consistently called [Beyond Protocol](http://beyond.link/) the next top three coin. Examples include [Crypto Rick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U4Dk-rGRkc), [Satoshi Sean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH1N6KWSShA), and [KIFS Crypto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLHgVep3tcI). Although a lot to consider, I generally agreed. This is a team from Stanford, IBM, Cisco, Amazon buoyed by Hollywood execs (it shows in their insane marketing; check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1txFf7Cv8K8) overview video). They are solving a big problem: devices in the future will need to pay each other digitally. The Gartners of the world have said there will be more transactions between devices than humans. Then I watched an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCt0R3N9uC4) with the CEO Jonathan Manzi and Tijo Bear. It's long -- 38 minutes. While I was watching it, it dawned on me that Beyond Protocol will be bigger than Bitcoin. Devices don't need just to be able to pay each other, they need to be made secure so they can open up to the world. The world can then develop on top of them. Beyond Protocol has built a frictionless technology which can be adopted with one line of code which makes spoofing -- the biggest pain point in cybersecurity right now -- probabilistically impossible. They do this by leveraging hardware signatures and distributed ledgers. Manzi explains it in less than 45s in [this](https://twitter.com/FlameCryptos/status/1404846333861765122) video tweet (watch it, everything will click!) What Beyond Protocol has built does two critical things. First, it makes devices secure for the first time. Now secure, they can open up. And now developers can build applications on top which unite them. Just from a smartphone, Apple's App Store brought us applications which changed the way we live: Uber, Instacart, etc. Beyond Protocol's Mega App Store will allow developers to build apps on not just an iPhone, but literally every device in the universe. Second, it allows devices to pay each other. And the \"pay each other\" part can get really nuts quickly. It can be autonomous vehicles paying each other for priority in a traffic grid. Or, it can be simply microtransactions which represent the amount of energy expended for a secure message to be sent between devices. Beyond Protocol is literally building the new Internet for devices. They are doing what the biggest companies in the world have tried to do in business consortia over the past decade but failed due to the battle of egos that always goes on -- one company trying to gain dominance over others. Beyond Protocol is opening a can of whoop-ass on all that. They're going all open-source protocol, just like ARPA when the internet was started, and they will win.

        "PostContent":[" Over the past month or so, analysts have consistently called [Beyond Protocol](http://beyond.link/) the next top three coin. Examples include [Crypto Rick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U4Dk-rGRkc), [Satoshi Sean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH1N6KWSShA), and [KIFS Crypto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLHgVep3tcI). Although a lot to consider, I generally agreed. This is a team from Stanford, IBM, Cisco, Amazon buoyed by Hollywood execs (it shows in their insane marketing; check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1txFf7Cv8K8) overview video). They are solving a big problem: devices in the future will need to pay each other digitally. The Gartners of the world have said there will be more transactions between devices than humans. Then I watched an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCt0R3N9uC4) with the CEO Jonathan Manzi and Tijo Bear. It's long -- 38 minutes. While I was watching it, it dawned on me that Beyond Protocol will be bigger than Bitcoin. Devices don't need just to be able to pay each other, they need to be made secure so they can open up to the world. The world can then develop on top of them. Beyond Protocol has built a frictionless technology which can be adopted with one line of code which makes spoofing -- the biggest pain point in cybersecurity right now -- probabilistically impossible. They do this by leveraging hardware signatures and distributed ledgers. Manzi explains it in less than 45s in [this](https://twitter.com/FlameCryptos/status/1404846333861765122) video tweet (watch it, everything will click!) What Beyond Protocol has built does two critical things. First, it makes devices secure for the first time. Now secure, they can open up. And now developers can build applications on top which unite them. Just from a smartphone, Apple's App Store brought us applications which changed the way we live: Uber, Instacart, etc. Beyond Protocol's Mega App Store will allow developers to build apps on not just an iPhone, but literally every device in the universe. Second, it allows devices to pay each other. And the \"pay each other\" part can get really nuts quickly. It can be autonomous vehicles paying each other for priority in a traffic grid. Or, it can be simply microtransactions which represent the amount of energy expended for a secure message to be sent between devices. Beyond Protocol is literally building the new Internet for devices. They are doing what the biggest companies in the world have tried to do in business consortia over the past decade but failed due to the battle of egos that always goes on -- one company trying to gain dominance over others. Beyond Protocol is opening a can of whoop-ass on all that. They're going all open-source protocol, just like ARPA when the internet was started, and they will win. Don't bet against an idea which time has come. I am a proud member of their Street Team by the way. I will do my best to answer any questions you might have.

Then I watched an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCt0R3N9uC4) with the CEO Jonathan Manzi and Tijo Bear. It's long -- 38 minutes. While I was watching it, it dawned on me that Beyond Protocol will be bigger than Bitcoin. Devices don't need just to be able to pay each other, they need to be made secure so they can open up to the world. The world can then develop on top of them. Beyond Protocol has built a frictionless technology which can be adopted with one line of code which makes spoofing -- the biggest pain point in cybersecurity right now -- probabilistically impossible. They do this by leveraging hardware signatures and distributed ledgers. Manzi explains it in less than 45s in [this](https://twitter.com/FlameCryptos/status/1404846333861765122) video tweet (watch it, everything will click!) What Beyond Protocol has built does two critical things. First, it makes devices secure for the first time. Now secure, they can open up. And now developers can build applications on top which unite them. Just from a smartphone, Apple's App Store brought us applications which changed the way we live: Uber, Instacart, etc. Beyond Protocol's Mega App Store will allow developers to build apps on not just an iPhone, but literally every device in the universe. Second, it allows devices to pay each other. And the \"pay each other\" part can get really nuts quickly. It can be autonomous vehicles paying each other for priority in a traffic grid. Or, it can be simply microtransactions which represent the amount of energy expended for a secure message to be sent between devices. Beyond Protocol is literally building the new Internet for devices. They are doing what the biggest companies in the world have tried to do in business consortia over the past decade but failed due to the battle of egos that always goes on -- one company trying to gain dominance over others. Beyond Protocol is opening a can of whoop-ass on all that. They're going all open-source protocol, just like ARPA when the internet was started, and they will win. Don't bet against an idea which time has come. I am a proud member of their Street Team by the way. I will do my best to answer any questions you might have.

        "PostContent":[" Over the past month or so, analysts have consistently called [Beyond Protocol](http://beyond.link/) the next top three coin. Examples include [Crypto Rick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U4Dk-rGRkc), [Satoshi Sean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH1N6KWSShA), and [KIFS Crypto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLHgVep3tcI). Although a lot to consider, I generally agreed. This is a team from Stanford, IBM, Cisco, Amazon buoyed by Hollywood execs (it shows in their insane marketing; check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1txFf7Cv8K8) overview video). They are solving a big problem: devices in the future will need to pay each other digitally. The Gartners of the world have said there will be more transactions between devices than humans. Then I watched an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCt0R3N9uC4) with the CEO Jonathan Manzi and Tijo Bear. It's long -- 38 minutes. While I was watching it, it dawned on me that Beyond Protocol will be bigger than Bitcoin. Devices don't need just to be able to pay each other, they need to be made secure so they can open up to the world. The world can then develop on top of them. Beyond Protocol has built a frictionless technology which can be adopted with one line of code which makes spoofing -- the biggest pain point in cybersecurity right now -- probabilistically impossible. They do this by leveraging hardware signatures and distributed ledgers. Manzi explains it in less than 45s in [this](https://twitter.com/FlameCryptos/status/1404846333861765122) video tweet (watch it, everything will click!) What Beyond Protocol has built does two critical things. First, it makes devices secure for the first time. Now secure, they can open up. And now developers can build applications on top which unite them. Just from a smartphone, Apple's App Store brought us applications which changed the way we live: Uber, Instacart, etc. Beyond Protocol's Mega App Store will allow developers to build apps on not just an iPhone, but literally every device in the universe. Second, it allows devices to pay each other. And the \"pay each other\" part can get really nuts quickly. It can be autonomous vehicles paying each other for priority in a traffic grid. Or, it can be simply microtransactions which represent the amount of energy expended for a secure message to be sent between devices. Beyond Protocol is literally building the new Internet for devices. They are doing what the biggest companies in the world have tried to do in business consortia over the past decade but failed due to the battle of egos that always goes on -- one company trying to gain dominance over others. Beyond Protocol is opening a can of whoop-ass on all that. They're going all open-source protocol, just like ARPA when the internet was started, and they will win.

        "PostContent":[" Over the past month or so, analysts have consistently called [Beyond Protocol](http://beyond.link/) the next top three coin. Examples include [Crypto Rick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U4Dk-rGRkc), [Satoshi Sean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH1N6KWSShA), and [KIFS Crypto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLHgVep3tcI). Although a lot to consider, I generally agreed. This is a team from Stanford, IBM, Cisco, Amazon buoyed by Hollywood execs (it shows in their insane marketing; check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1txFf7Cv8K8) overview video). They are solving a big problem: devices in the future will need to pay each other digitally. The Gartners of the world have said there will be more transactions between devices than humans. Then I watched an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCt0R3N9uC4) with the CEO Jonathan Manzi and Tijo Bear. It's long -- 38 minutes. While I was watching it, it dawned on me that Beyond Protocol will be bigger than Bitcoin. Devices don't need just to be able to pay each other, they need to be made secure so they can open up to the world. The world can then develop on top of them. Beyond Protocol has built a frictionless technology which can be adopted with one line of code which makes spoofing -- the biggest pain point in cybersecurity right now -- probabilistically impossible. They do this by leveraging hardware signatures and distributed ledgers. Manzi explains it in less than 45s in [this](https://twitter.com/FlameCryptos/status/1404846333861765122) video tweet (watch it, everything will click!) What Beyond Protocol has built does two critical things. First, it makes devices secure for the first time. Now secure, they can open up. And now developers can build applications on top which unite them. Just from a smartphone, Apple's App Store brought us applications which changed the way we live: Uber, Instacart, etc. Beyond Protocol's Mega App Store will allow developers to build apps on not just an iPhone, but literally every device in the universe. Second, it allows devices to pay each other. And the \"pay each other\" part can get really nuts quickly. It can be autonomous vehicles paying each other for priority in a traffic grid. Or, it can be simply microtransactions which represent the amount of energy expended for a secure message to be sent between devices. Beyond Protocol is literally building the new Internet for devices. They are doing what the biggest companies in the world have tried to do in business consortia over the past decade but failed due to the battle of egos that always goes on -- one company trying to gain dominance over others. Beyond Protocol is opening a can of whoop-ass on all that. They're going all open-source protocol, just like ARPA when the internet was started, and they will win. Don't bet against an idea which time has come. I am a proud member of their Street Team by the way. I will do my best to answer any questions you might have.

        "PostContent":[" Over the past month or so, analysts have consistently called [Beyond Protocol](http://beyond.link/) the next top three coin. Examples include [Crypto Rick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U4Dk-rGRkc), [Satoshi Sean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH1N6KWSShA), and [KIFS Crypto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLHgVep3tcI). Although a lot to consider, I generally agreed. This is a team from Stanford, IBM, Cisco, Amazon buoyed by Hollywood execs (it shows in their insane marketing; check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1txFf7Cv8K8) overview video). They are solving a big problem: devices in the future will need to pay each other digitally. The Gartners of the world have said there will be more transactions between devices than humans. Then I watched an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCt0R3N9uC4) with the CEO Jonathan Manzi and Tijo Bear. It's long -- 38 minutes. While I was watching it, it dawned on me that Beyond Protocol will be bigger than Bitcoin. Devices don't need just to be able to pay each other, they need to be made secure so they can open up to the world. The world can then develop on top of them. Beyond Protocol has built a frictionless technology which can be adopted with one line of code which makes spoofing -- the biggest pain point in cybersecurity right now -- probabilistically impossible. They do this by leveraging hardware signatures and distributed ledgers. Manzi explains it in less than 45s in [this](https://twitter.com/FlameCryptos/status/1404846333861765122) video tweet (watch it, everything will click!) What Beyond Protocol has built does two critical things. First, it makes devices secure for the first time. Now secure, they can open up. And now developers can build applications on top which unite them. Just from a smartphone, Apple's App Store brought us applications which changed the way we live: Uber, Instacart, etc. Beyond Protocol's Mega App Store will allow developers to build apps on not just an iPhone, but literally every device in the universe. Second, it allows devices to pay each other. And the \"pay each other\" part can get really nuts quickly. It can be autonomous vehicles paying each other for priority in a traffic grid. Or, it can be simply microtransactions which represent the amount of energy expended for a secure message to be sent between devices. Beyond Protocol is literally building the new Internet for devices. They are doing what the biggest companies in the world have tried to do in business consortia over the past decade but failed due to the battle of egos that always goes on -- one company trying to gain dominance over others. Beyond Protocol is opening a can of whoop-ass on all that. They're going all open-source protocol, just like ARPA when the internet was started, and they will win. Don't bet against an idea which time has come. I am a proud member of their Street Team by the way. I will do my best to answer any questions you might have.

        "PostContent":[" Over the past month or so, analysts have consistently called [Beyond Protocol](http://beyond.link/) the next top three coin. Examples include [Crypto Rick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U4Dk-rGRkc), [Satoshi Sean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH1N6KWSShA), and [KIFS Crypto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLHgVep3tcI). Although a lot to consider, I generally agreed. This is a team from Stanford, IBM, Cisco, Amazon buoyed by Hollywood execs (it shows in their insane marketing; check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1txFf7Cv8K8) overview video). They are solving a big problem: devices in the future will need to pay each other digitally. The Gartners of the world have said there will be more transactions between devices than humans. Then I watched an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCt0R3N9uC4) with the CEO Jonathan Manzi and Tijo Bear. It's long -- 38 minutes. While I was watching it, it dawned on me that Beyond Protocol will be bigger than Bitcoin. Devices don't need just to be able to pay each other, they need to be made secure so they can open up to the world. The world can then develop on top of them. Beyond Protocol has built a frictionless technology which can be adopted with one line of code which makes spoofing -- the biggest pain point in cybersecurity right now -- probabilistically impossible. They do this by leveraging hardware signatures and distributed ledgers. Manzi explains it in less than 45s in [this](https://twitter.com/FlameCryptos/status/1404846333861765122) video tweet (watch it, everything will click!) What Beyond Protocol has built does two critical things. First, it makes devices secure for the first time. Now secure, they can open up. And now developers can build applications on top which unite them. Just from a smartphone, Apple's App Store brought us applications which changed the way we live: Uber, Instacart, etc. Beyond Protocol's Mega App Store will allow developers to build apps on not just an iPhone, but literally every device in the universe. Second, it allows devices to pay each other. And the \"pay each other\" part can get really nuts quickly. It can be autonomous vehicles paying each other for priority in a traffic grid. Or, it can be simply microtransactions which represent the amount of energy expended for a secure message to be sent between devices. Beyond Protocol is literally building the new Internet for devices. They are doing what the biggest companies in the world have tried to do in business consortia over the past decade but failed due to the battle of egos that always goes on -- one company trying to gain dominance over others. Beyond Protocol is opening a can of whoop-ass on all that. They're going all open-source protocol, just like ARPA when the internet was started, and they will win. Don't bet against an idea which time has come. I am a proud member of their Street Team by the way. I will do my best to answer any questions you might have.

Beyond Protocol is literally building the new Internet for devices. They are doing what the biggest companies in the world have tried to do in business consortia over the past decade but failed due to the battle of egos that always goes on -- one company trying to gain dominance over others. Beyond Protocol is opening a can of whoop-ass on all that. They're going all open-source protocol, just like ARPA when the internet was started, and they will win. Don't bet against an idea which time has come. I am a proud member of their Street Team by the way. I will do my best to answer any questions you might have.

        "PostContent":[" Over the past month or so, analysts have consistently called [Beyond Protocol](http://beyond.link/) the next top three coin. Examples include [Crypto Rick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U4Dk-rGRkc), [Satoshi Sean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH1N6KWSShA), and [KIFS Crypto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLHgVep3tcI). Although a lot to consider, I generally agreed. This is a team from Stanford, IBM, Cisco, Amazon buoyed by Hollywood execs (it shows in their insane marketing; check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1txFf7Cv8K8) overview video). They are solving a big problem: devices in the future will need to pay each other digitally. The Gartners of the world have said there will be more transactions between devices than humans. Then I watched an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCt0R3N9uC4) with the CEO Jonathan Manzi and Tijo Bear. It's long -- 38 minutes. While I was watching it, it dawned on me that Beyond Protocol will be bigger than Bitcoin. Devices don't need just to be able to pay each other, they need to be made secure so they can open up to the world. The world can then develop on top of them. Beyond Protocol has built a frictionless technology which can be adopted with one line of code which makes spoofing -- the biggest pain point in cybersecurity right now -- probabilistically impossible. They do this by leveraging hardware signatures and distributed ledgers. Manzi explains it in less than 45s in [this](https://twitter.com/FlameCryptos/status/1404846333861765122) video tweet (watch it, everything will click!) What Beyond Protocol has built does two critical things. First, it makes devices secure for the first time. Now secure, they can open up. And now developers can build applications on top which unite them. Just from a smartphone, Apple's App Store brought us applications which changed the way we live: Uber, Instacart, etc. Beyond Protocol's Mega App Store will allow developers to build apps on not just an iPhone, but literally every device in the universe. Second, it allows devices to pay each other. And the \"pay each other\" part can get really nuts quickly. It can be autonomous vehicles paying each other for priority in a traffic grid. Or, it can be simply microtransactions which represent the amount of energy expended for a secure message to be sent between devices. Beyond Protocol is literally building the new Internet for devices. They are doing what the biggest companies in the world have tried to do in business consortia over the past decade but failed due to the battle of egos that always goes on -- one company trying to gain dominance over others. Beyond Protocol is opening a can of whoop-ass on all that. They're going all open-source protocol, just like ARPA when the internet was started, and they will win.

According to the results, it is possible to say that the number of people who know about cryptocurrency and hold it is increasing. However, among people who have knowledge about crypto the most heard about bitcoin and are unable to identify other cryptos. At the same time there is a decline in understanding cryptocurrency. So some people heard about it, but do not understand what it is. 71% of respondents were able to give a definition to it, which is less than a year ago. Have you noticed this trend? Does it seem like people do not have enough knowledge about crypto now?"],

        "PostContent":["I'm really not great at maths so maybe this question doesn't even make sense but my thought process is like this: 1. Crypto [and internet security in general for that matter] relies on very complex mathematical problems including enormous prime numbers and algorithms that can't practically be reverse engineered 2. They can't be reverse engineered because of how much computing power and time it would take 3. Quantum computers can solve these kind of mathematical problems virtually instantaneously 4. Therefore quantum computing could make traditional computing equations and security obsolete. Analogy: before gunpowder was a thing, castles and metal plate armour were the height of security. Once gunpowder was introduced it rendered castles and metal plate armour obsolete. Just a thought I had and as I say maybe the question itself doesn't even make sense due to my incomplete understanding but I would be curious to hear other's thoughts on the matter.
