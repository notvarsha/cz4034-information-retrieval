( other than satoshi or vitalik ) i honestly do n't think theres anything he could do to ever satisfy you . the fact is he does n't owe you anything . just because he has more reach than the average joe does n't mean he is obligated to dedicate his entire life to crypto . he 's living his life as he personally sees fit just as everyone else here is . it should be enough for you that one of the most famous people in the world is discussing his interest in crypto and making moves . this post just comes off as salty . he 's in the news because he 's interesting , opinionated , and is a celebrity talking about crypto . not because he 's some crypto idol who 's word is gospel ."],

( for your information , bitcoin is n't safe . it 's fully transparent . use [ monero ] ( https : //www.getmonero.org/ ) ) . significant other be grateful for that , maybe , role model or not . boring company : i do n't see anyone else innovating and disrupting our trashy road industry with something that does n't suck significant other much . they even reuse , recycle , and sell the bricks from the waste . pair that with tesla 's autonomous vehicles ( which they made their own artificial intelligence hardware for because nvidia was n't ( still is n't ) good enough . ) and you 'll see a revolution in driving that saves lives , is more stable , and more sustainable . neuralink : hacking at a keyboard like a caveman or typing on a phone with my thumbs is some archaic bullshit . neuralink will change that along with bringing actual medical services to many many people , an increasing amount of people ( thank you , trashy american healthcare service , the most expensive in the world ) . openai : he started it . i 'm sure i 'm forgetting elon 's other projects . it 's hard to remember them all . when i see people vaguely insult elon and compare him to mark fuckerberg , i can tell those people have little to no clue what they 're talking about . mark zuckerberg is * obviously * an evil mother fucker , yet how many of you keep using his obviously flawed spyware called facebook ? yes , i hate billionaires too , but am i the only dumb american who sees that elon has helped bring in a green new deal , which we * desperately * need , where all other companies , politicians , voters , and big oil have kept back for decades ? fuck the bitcoin . do n't give a fuck . i * do * give a fuck about all the disruption to these old-ass zombified capitalist industries that have proven capitalism * does not * bring about the best product or competition . it 's the exact opposite . maybe one day morons will realize capitalism has always been the problem . billionaires are the ones to do these things because capitalism * rewards * those who have the most money ! ! ! ! how many of you have asked bill gates to `` save us '' because he has the money to do it ? i do n't see mark fuckerberg doing a damn thing to improve the lives of other people , ever , yet i still see idiots using facebook . i see elon starting companies to do those very things : clean energy , cleaner production , multiplanetary life , etc . role model or not , maybe check yourselves before you wreck yourselves . if you think any of these things are somehow bullshit , then you 're not paying nearly enough attention as you should be ( laugh out loud i hope it 's not because you 're on facebook ; ) ) ( yes , elon does n't treat his workers right . unionize everything or start worker cooperatives . make billionaires irrelevant . i 'd * love * to see that ) ."],
