Two interviews were put out recently that try to make it seem that they were done after Oct 17th but in reality they were not. If you don't dismiss what I am saying instantly and dig around, you will see that many people have been aware of this since the 17th but most attempts to discuss it were blacked out quickly.

If Assange is not in the embassy this is hugely damaging PR for Sweden and Ecuador because they will effectively been lying to the public for the past 2 days. I can't see them being this complicit in any operation that ends with the public finding out Assange is dead or in US custody. It will be particularly damaging to the Swedish judiciary given Assange's assertions that the allegations against him were a ruse to get him out of the U.K. and a forward extradition to the US. It will be interesting to see how this plays out, but I'm hoping I'm right and Assange is just a victim of an Internet ban rather than anything more nefarious.

I do not want another 1000 comments to read in the morning in order to properly police the sub when I wake up. It will be back in ~12h, I'm guessing. Edit: 3x insults (now 6x) against the moderators via the report function isn't going to get the thread unlocked faster. This thread doesn't even really belong in this subreddit in the first place, our focus is on algorithms and theory. This sub isn't political. Edit 2: **A response to the submission reports**: Political discussions doesn't belong here at all if it is not related to cryptography policy, and it isn't enough that the topic is about somebody who is merely using cryptography. It is the algorithms we are interested in. You have to respect the rules of the subreddit you are visiting. Speculation also doesn't belong here, and neither does personal attacks and insults and harassment, which there already had been a lot of before I locked the thread. And no, contrary to what the reports says, it isn't ""lazy"" to not want to herd wild cats. This thread was flooded by people coming from 10+ larger subreddits, many of which was ignoring our rules. You can't expect the moderators of a normally low volume subreddit to deal with that - I could barely keep up with *reading* the new comments as they were made, and the volume was increasing! And you also can't demand to hold your discussions in subreddits where they are off topic, either. If you want an unmoderated discussion, make your own sub for it!

What happened was unprecedented, and Im feeling like the tipping point occurred AFTER Julian was essentially unplugged at the embassy. As the leaks continued It simply became impossible for the MSM to frame the story around Assange or distract from the content of the leaks, regardless of attempts to obfuscate truth or collusion with the state. His silence is what allowed the information in the leaks to permeate to the point where most Americans still alseep were confronted with serious challenges to the very validity their worldview. The election results and aftermath are indicative of this anger or fear reaction. Many angry people voted their conscience, many voted as a giant 'fuck you' to the status quo system, and those still clinglng to the false reality they bought into long ago have been in tears, blathering all over social media, or are protesting and rioting in the streets. That said , how is this community of all people still hyperfocused on Assange. Its not about him. Thats the whole point.

Torrent files are normally named with the extension .torrent.","bernmont2016","3","2016-11-16 08:09:46"

","438498967","4325","2016-11-15 07:00:12","Wikileaks has an insurance file, which is just a giant data dump of all the information they have, published or not. Wikileaks does screen hold back some of the most damning things as 'Insurance' which, if their operation were ever compromised, they would release the decryption key which opens the massive data dump file. Think of it as a dead man switch. Before they release their insurance file, they release a hash of it; a hash is a kind of like a checksum. It doesn't contain the data, but it is a way of ensuring the data hasn't been altered. Think of it this way: if I took all the paint from an image, mix up all the paint to make a new color, that new color contains elements from the original image. I could then do that with a copy of a picture to see if the new color matched the color from the original image. If it didn't match, I could conclude that the copy wasn't the original. What has happened, is the hash they released last month doesn't match the hash for the insurance file. This could have happed for many reasons, either when they uploaded the insurance file, there was a transmission error, or the original hash wasn't correct. It's also possible that Wikileaks has been compromised and to keep up appearances to prevent the release of the decryption key the responsible party released a fake insurance file. Most likely it's a mistake, maybe they accidently released the hash for the unencrypted version, or a transmission failure happened. I would standby and wait and see before jumping to speculation.","callmeon","1","2016-11-16 10:36:01","You mean Marshmello ","NathanialJD","1","2016-11-16 11:00:07"

The last nail in the coffin for me was when, in that sketchy-ass AMA, ""Sarah Harrison"" used the WikiLeaks twitter account as proof, no imgur selfie, no PGP sig, just a twitter post. I argued with a couple of the IAmA mods and apparently they saw a selfie, and she wanted to post it to imgur, but ""couldn't figure out how"". Yeah, that's correct Sarah Harrison, WikiLeaks editor and investigative journalist apparently doesn't know how to use imgur. On top of that, the mods refused to post the pic THAT SHE SUPPOSEDLY MEANT TO POST HERSELF. I call bullshit. Interestingly enough one of the mods that I talked to deleted his own public comments a few days later.

","438498967","4325","2016-11-15 07:00:12","Think of a hash as a globally unique ID for a specific lump of data. The programs that generate hashes do it repeatably, so the same data would produce the same hash if run through the hashing code twice or on different computers, but if you change even the tiniest piece of the data and run it through again, you get a completely different hash. So it gives you a relatively short bit of text that you can use to check if one lump of data is exactly the same as another, which is useful for encryption and making sure that files aren't tampered with. In this case, the hashes don't match, which is set up to be a red flag that something is going on. It could be tampering, data corruption, human error, or some other mix-up, but the file they had before isn't exactly the same as what they shared now.","callmeon","1","2016-11-16 10:36:01","You mean Marshmello ","NathanialJD","1","2016-11-16 11:00:07"

So they post the hashes to allow people to verify that they got an authentic torrent download, which could otherwise be potentially messed-with at any point in the future. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrent_file > In the BitTorrent file distribution system, a torrent file is a computer file that contains metadata about files and folders to be distributed, and usually also a list of the network locations of trackers, which are computers that help participants in the system find each other and form efficient distribution groups called swarms.[1] A torrent file does not contain the content to be distributed; it only contains information about those files, such as their names, sizes, folder structure, and cryptographic hash values for verifying file integrity. ...

Isn't the idea supposed to be that wikileaks is putting important damning information into the hands of the people, exposing what ""they"" don't want us to know? Isn't this just replacing the government (or whoever)'s judgement with wikileaks's judgement on what should be redacted, so now wikileaks becomes the new ""they?"" If that's their mission, how could they withhold the juiciest stuff and still be considered to uphold that mission?

It's a good idea to use it even if you know what you're doing, since having the same setup as most users will make it harder to de-anonymize you. For even better protection, I'd suggest using something like tails linux. It requires basically no setup. And there are some things that tor can't protect very well against. If you enter the clearweb through tor, you need to be abke to trust the exit node. Furthermore, correlation attacks can be very effective. There's no real way to protect against those, make sure to access the internet in a way that can't be traced to you (like public wifi) anf consider using a tor bridge.

","438498967","4325","2016-11-15 07:00:12","> only that file can be reduced to Technically hash collisions are a thing. Here's another way to explain it: Assume you have hash(myFile) and yourFile; if hash(yourFile) is not equal to hash(myFile), then you have a different file. A trivial (and poor) hash on sentences would be taking the first letter of the sentence. poorHash(""I am a dog"") => ""I"", poorHash(""Potato"") => ""P"". ""I"" is not ""P"" so clearly the hashs' inputs were different. However, poorHash(""I am potato"") => ""I"", so poorHash(""I am a dog"") is equal to poorHash(""I am potato""). That doesn't mean their inputs were identical. For cryptographic hashes you have much larger inputs and, furthermore, minor deviations in inputs are supposed to result in large changes in outputs (there are other important factors too, but I digress). Even then, if your'e doing e.g. a 512-bit hash, you have 2^512 possible outputs max - and you can certainly provide 2^512 + 1 inputs which would certainly mean a hash collision - that's known as the pidgeonhole principle.","callmeon","1","2016-11-16 10:36:01","You mean Marshmello ","NathanialJD","1","2016-11-16 11:00:07"

Only the exact same files with the exact same content will generate the same signature. Important to note is that the algorithm is public and not modifiable; anyone can run it and generate the same signature, given the same files as input. The only way for them to upload files that, after applying the algorithm mentioned before, generate the same signature, is by uploading *the exact same files*. Which apparently they didn't do, as we're seeing a different signature. Hope that makes sense!

If they match, the file is good. If not, the file is somehow not a match for the file from which the pre-commitment has was derived.

Even if it was just going to the window. And why wasn't his lawyer allowed to be present for the meeting with the prosecutor?

They don't care who is president, they care about keeping whatever massive secret he was going to drop.

The simple explanation is that it's surprisingly easy to find two people who have the same birthday give a relatively small number of people. (For thirty people, there's about a 70% chance that at least one pair of them share a birthday) So extrapolating that fact to cryography, even if there are a huge number of possible hashes (2^256, or 1.2 × 10^77) , you only need to try a vastly smaller number (5.7 × 10^38) of inputs to have a 75% chance of finding at least one matching pair.

","438498967","4325","2016-11-15 07:00:12","There's a theory that WL is either run by Russians or has Russian operatives embedded in the organization/controlling content released that could hurt Russia and its interests. There was a thread a while back that showed 6ish years ago (2011) WL was about to release damaging information about the Russians. That never happened after Russia took a strong stance against WL, and nothing to speak of has come out since about Russia. Some think that WL was either intimidated, infiltrated, or taken over by Russian agents at that time, and has since been only leaking damaging information about the West. There's also a 1997 Kremlin document outlining things that Russia wants to do to advance its position in the world, and among other things it talks about creating racial tensions and whatnot in the US, and getting UK out of EU, all of which are to increase the influence of Russia. This is a tl;dr, and hopefully you can find the threads showing more detail and sources. I'm too lazy atm. While I find this all to be plausible, and I am more skeptical of WL agenda, I still think Hillary and the DNC are shit. Just because Russia or WL has motive to show corruption, doesn't mean we should ignore the corruption. Anyway, it's not confirmed that this is what has actually happened. Still something to consider and be aware of.

And how were they biased? Because I follow all of them closely, including subscribing and donating and there was certainly NOTHING like an outlet like fox news did, they were still as fair as I think they could be expected to be. The problem is we no longer have an agreed upon baseline of facts. So reporting of facts is literally biased now in mant people's minds because everything is a fucking conspiracy. I would argue they all personally were against Trump(even though I don't believe it affected their ability to deliver news as objectively as possible) and it was because of who Trump is, what his policies were, and what he stands for. They, along with many others, see him to be a potential true threat to American politics and democracy and now we are going to see where this goes. If you disagree let's talk policy.

The reality is, the DNC has some ridiculously bad data security issues and all of it was released. The RNC may or may not have similar issues, but were not hacked in the same way otherwise you'd have seen their data as well. Very few sources will hide juicy click money like that on purpose. Your issue is with selective hackers, perhaps, but definitely not selective reporting. Wikileaks can only report what it has.

Studying cryptography was my gateway into crypto assets, but it can work the other way too. Why not sticky a post that welcomes people who stumble in here, and gives links to resources on public/private keys, hash algorithms, zero-knowledge proofs, as well as intros to non-currency cryptography topics? And then gently remind posters that discussions should be around tech and not assets/prices.

Nah. Cryptography has been around much longer than cryptocurrency and will be around long after the crypto-currency bubble bursts. I'm not willing to concede the ground anytime soon. I was around for the dotcom bubble bursting - companies were putting ""internet"" and ""dotcom"" in their names and getting massive valuations just for acknowledging this fancy new thing. At the end of the day, ""cryptocurrency"" means ""currencies whose integrity are protected by cryptographic principles"". Their name is meaningless without ours as a reference.

Cryptographers and most of the rest of tech has not abandoned the old meaning. Our usage is older. *We are still here*. Cryptographers still exclusively use it to mean cryptography. You can make the same claim about energy and physics, claiming physics should give up the work because snakeoil alternative medicine nutjobs are using it and most average people only know of their usage of it. Doesn't matter! They're wrong about its scientific definition! You don't get to tell the scientists to abandon their terminology! 2) So what? Your usage of cryptocurrency literally means *cryptographic currency*. You're literally using crypto in cryptocurrency to mean cryptography. To redefine crypto as cryptocurrency means you kill it the reference to cryptography, the thing that makes it work. How does that possibly make sense to you!? > The originators of a term are those who give it their popular definition Lies and absurd logic. Cryptographers popularized cryptography! They're the ones who used the word for decades! You *do not* suddenly own the word because you took *our* word and added a new meaning to it. Words have a meaning! To originate something is to create it, be first, to introduce it. Cryptographers did that! You do not get to claim that you can steal the word due to larger numbers of followers! > We use the term as a noun whereas your use of ""crypto"" is a bastardized adjective.

Using a shorthand of ""things that are secret"" in reference to cryptography makes more sense than you using it to mean ""currencies built using study of secrets"". It is your usage of it that is completely absurd. > Furthermore, the pioneers of crypto currency are cryptographers themselves. It IS our term. Lmao. Satoshi was just a hobby cryptographer, evident by his code that and writings. A good one with a unique idea, yet still new to the field. Then he invited actual cryptographers, yes. But that was only a few - NONE OF WHICH used the word ""crypto"" to mean cryptocurrency, invalidating your claim that it's ""your"" term, as the people that started using that meaning wasn't cryptographers. They were outsiders, with *no* claim to the word. But then it also wasn't cryptographers that took it and ran with it. It was newbies doing speculation. It was random people coming from nowhere and speculating in new markets. They're not that same ""us"" as the people studying the field of cryptography. Like physics' use of the word energy, they had no claim to force the original field to drop their use of the word. > We created and popularized it. Lies, and irrelevant.

It's the cryptocurrency folks who hijacked crypto from cryptographers.","Natanael_L","6","2018-02-28 17:43:51"

Make no mistake: the US government engages in some seriously unethical and unconstitutional practices online in the name of stopping the [four horsemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Horsemen_of_the_Infocalypse), but this change doesn't go as far as people seem to believe. It only states that judges may issue warrants for machines located outside their jurisdiction (bear in mind, issuance of a warrant has no bearing on the feasibility of executing it, so this is really no different than any black hat trying to compromise your machine, use updated software and secure settings), and that they may issue warrants if they cannot determine the location of a machine. Nothing in here indicates any type of watchlist will be used. They aren't saying ""he's using a VPN, he must be a criminal"", they're saying ""an online crime was committed, and in the course of investigating it, we uncovered someone using a VPN"", and can still issue a warrant even if we aren't sure where the target is located. In terms of practical impact, consider how many groups, from nation states to criminals to benign (think Shodan) routinely port scan and attempt to compromise machines all over the internet. The only change is that now the FBI has the authority to do something every script kiddie in his basement was already attempting. Your machine is as safe as you configure it to be.","TotesMessenger","3","2016-11-30 00:13:37","ok ty bot","chickyrogue","4","2016-11-30 00:30:08"

Most headlines we've seen are heavily dramatized. There is no ""FBI watch list"" specified in these bills, nothing like that. There is no ""mass surveillance bill"". It's how they start using their new authority that is the problem. For example, the Patriot Act is actually pretty damn reasonable in regards to fighting terrorism, what it exists to fight. However, they've been able to let things slide due to it existing. Nowhere does it state that you can use these powers for mass surveillance, but mass surveillance does become more powerful under the bill and people assume it's legal because of the bill. However, if a court really wanted to dig into it, no one could use the defense ""patriot act"" to protect themselves if the court was trying to nail someone for using mass surveillance technology. It's watching people who have no link to terrorism or computer fraud. That's what the patriot act is there for, not general mass surveillance. But the bill gave them more leeway and they stretched their authority as far as they could. The bill is terrible, but not because of the wording, but because of how people use the new powers that they have access to. I forget the latest one, was it SOPA? Or it was called the ""new SOPA/PIPA"" or something. Either way, I read it in its entirety and it's extremely reasonable. It's allowing government and private sector to share data and work together and it DOES have privacy requirements, stripping of personal information of people that aren't related to the crime. It's actually not bad *if it was used as it should be*. However, it opens up a lot more authority for the intelligence agencies to work closely with private sector in ways the bill doesn't cover. It opens up a conversation that couldn't exist in the past. They will use it for mass surveillance even if it wasn't stated that way or even made legal. There is no punishment for those that break the privacy laws it extends, they just have to put ""best efforts"" to strip personal data of people who aren't being investigated. I expect it'll be the same with this one. The wording is going to be reasonable, it's going to seem really nice and dandy but it's going to give them powers to investigate VPNs and Tor activity closer. Instead of dropping a case, they'll be able to get logs from VPNs. They will use this in bad ways the bill doesn't specify. They will get logs of people who haven't committed any crime and weren't being investigated for that. They'll keep asking for logs despite investigations. They'll aggregate them into one VPN/Tor utility that allows them to deanonymize people. They'll deanonymize everyone they can, not just potential criminals. They'll patch it in to their mass surveillance framework that really has no right to exist. That's why this kind of thing should be blocked. It's misinformation stating that it allows them to add you to watchlists and stuff like that, but that might be the end result regardless. It won't be good for privacy due to how its used, not how its worded.","TotesMessenger","3","2016-11-30 00:13:37","ok ty bot","chickyrogue","4","2016-11-30 00:30:08"

What's worse, the private RSA/ECDHE key of server can be hacked, and that companies like VeriSign actually sign rogue certificates for LEA purposes. PKI isn't secure against the government. In comparison Tor's a bit different. It's using Curve25519 ECDHE, it's own infra for public key delivery. But as long as we rely on TLS delivering the Tor client, FOSS client might have trust issues.

All possible digests are 2^3 = 8 in total. 000,001,010,011,100,101,110,111 Now you are going to give F3 messages which are 5 bits long. A hash collision is eminent. There are 2^5 = 32 such messages. In the case of SHA1, we search for a collision by trying to find two large messages (who are larger than 160 bits,) but whom both map to the same 160b digest. Researchers in Amsterdam went further.

One is the good program. The second is the good program plus some viruses. Most people won't go through all of the source code. Also, due to the ability to write # comments #, more or less arbitrary data is allowed. I find collisions in my two source codes. They both have a hash digest of 2F2H13...09. I submit the good, harmless one to a third party. The third party audits the code and announces that Program X, with a SHA-1 source code of 2F2H13...09 is good. I then release tarballs of the bad version of my program. Visitors to my site download the code and ""verify"" that the SHA-1 digest is 2F2H13...09 when they actually have the bad code. Other party: I draft up two contracts. One says you sell me your bike for $50. The second says you sell me your house for $50. I add white space to the end of each until I reach a collision in their SHA-1 digests. I give the bike contract for you to sign. You make the mistake of signing with SHA-1. I take the signature and copy it onto the house contract, upon which it will ""verify"". I take the house contract to a judge and claim you sold me your house. SHA-1 is flawed, so a birthday attack on average will cost about 2^78 time. The time needed for a chosen prefix collision attack should take 2^80, but due to flaws, it only takes 2^77. In order to have two contracts to commit fraud I need to make sure my collisions occur across both sets, so it takes (2^77)*2 time, or, 2^78 time. And yes, I still see SHA-1 and MD5 hashes for source code, even if the site itself uses SHA256 or greater in its TLS certificate. To be collision-proof beyond feasibility, SHA256, which is double 128. To have protection against quantum birthday attacks, triple your bits, or 128*3=384 as in SHA384.

Second pre-image attacks against HMAC-SHA1 are not. The reason is that birthday attacks involve making two files from scratch that hash to the same value. HMAC as in TOTP uses a shared secret. Only those with the shared secret could launch birthday attacks, i.e., you or Google. Second pre-image attacks involve an outside observer looking at your original data and the hash and finding something that matches an already given hash output. HMAC-SHA1 has 160 bits of security here. SHA-1 at a minimum has 105 bits (due to flaws in Merkle-Damgard and the internal sizes) Regular pre-image attacks involve an attacker only seeing the hash output and nothing else. To forge that, for SHA-1 or HMAC-SHA1, requires 2^160 time on average. Even an ideal 160-bit hash gives only 80 bits in collision attacks (81 if you need to find collisions in two sets, as with making two contracts for fraud). That is still too weak. Any output below ~99 bits of security has no long-term security. SHA-1 is still safe for PGP keys' fingerprints and will be even in a post-quantum world. SHA-1 no matter what, gives us at least 105 bits. PGP key data isn't that much, but let's say 105 instead of 160 bits. PGP keys can't be arbitrary data, which knocks most attacks. These aren't large tarballs of code. Also, a birthday attack, no matter how it was done, only proves that you are the author. Any two PGP keys with the same SHA-1 fingerprint had to have been created by the same person with a >99.99999999.....% probability. You can't make a second key and then disavow stuff signed with your first key, saying that an identity thief is out there. We would all know you created both keys. TOTP, in a post-quantum world should be HMAC-SHA256, to give 128-1 bits of security against brute force attacks (2^127 attempts succeed with a 50% probability) and to protect a 256-bit symmetric key. 256-bit keys will be necessary in a post-quantum world.","TomatoZombie","-2","2017-02-24 05:18:00","Obviously there are collisions.

They could have used something much weaker but Torvalds apparently thought “Why not use SHA-1, it won't hurt?”. Also: What niloc describes requires a preimage-attack, whereas the thing presented here is a simple collision, meaning that the attacker that uploads stuff would need to have commit-rights in the first place, which makes the attack pretty much pointless. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that you should use SHA-1 for new software, or that this cannot be dangerous for things like signatures, but it really depends on the use-case. Similar things apply for password-hashing: At this point SHA-1 really isn't worse than SHA-2, they are pretty much equally bad: The requirements for password-hashing are extremely different from those of regular hashes and you should really, really use the functions that are designed for it specifically like Argon2. (I would even argue that being able to generate lots and lots of collisions very easily once you have one pre-image might be a **feature** for that use-case as long as pre-images are still hard, as that would make it very difficult to figure out which of the many preimages is the actual password.)","TomatoZombie","-2","2017-02-24 05:18:00","Obviously there are collisions.

""development of TrueCrypt was ended in 5/2014""","","xr1s","258","2014-05-29 03:09:42","* **Developers have responded:** https://www.grc.com/misc/truecrypt/truecrypt.htm | https://twitter.com/stevebarnhart/status/472192457145597952 >Steven Barnhart (@stevebarnhart) wrote to an eMail address he had used before and received several replies from “David.” The following snippets were taken from a twitter conversation which then took place between Steven Barnhart (@stevebarnhart) and Matthew Green (@matthew_d_green): > > TrueCrypt Developer “David”: “We were happy with the audit, it didn't spark anything. We worked hard on this for 10 years, nothing lasts forever.” > > Steven Barnhart: (Paraphrasing) Developer “personally” feels that fork is harmful: “The source is still available as a reference though.” > > Steven Barnhart: “I asked and it was clear from the reply that ""he"" believes forking's harmful because only they are really familiar w/code.” > > Steven Barnhart: “Also said no government contact except one time inquiring about a ‘support contract.' ” > > TrueCrypt Developer “David”: Said “Bitlocker is ‘good enough' and Windows was original ‘goal of the project.' ” > > Quoting TrueCrypt Developer David: “There is no longer interest.” -------------------------------- The binary on the website is capable only to decode encrypted data, not encode, and may contain trojan (seems like it doesn't, but don't believe me). The binary is signed with the valid (usual) key. All old versions are wiped, the repository is wiped too. -------------------------------- **Assumption #1** The website is presumed hacked, the keys are presumed compromised. Please do not download or run it. And please don't switch to bitlocker. Latest **working** version is 7.1a. **Version 7.2 is a hoax** On the SourceForge, the keys were changed before any TrueCrypt files uploaded, but now they are deleted and the old keys got reverted back. Why I think so: strange key change, why bitlocker? -------------------------------- **Assumption #2** Something bad happened to TrueCrypt developers (i.e. take down or death) or to TrueCrypt itself (i.e. found the worst vulnerability ever) which made them do such a thing. So this version is **legit** Why I think so: all files are with valid signatures, all the releases are available (Windows; Linux x86, x86_64, console versions, Mac OS, sources), the binaries seems like was built on the usual developer PC (there are some paths like c:\\truecrypt-7.2\\driver\\obj_driver_release\\i386\\truecrypt.pdb, which were the same for 7.1a). **License text is changed too** (see the diff below). Why is it ridiculous for TrueCrypt developers to suggest moving to BitLocker? Well, TrueCrypt was strictly against of using [TPM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module) because it may contain extra key chains which allow agencies like NSA to extract your private key. Although I find TPM to be a great solution in some cases (like embedded systems where you can't return to OS from fullscreen application) and used it a lot as a developer, I can't imagine why would TrueCrypt developers suggest such a thing and not other open-source alternatives. It looks like a clear sign that the developer can't say he's in danger so he did this. As many suppose, this could be the sort of [warrant canary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary) Assumption #2 is more likely true than assumption #1. Sad but true. -------------------------------- **Assumption #3** 7.1a is backdoored and the developer wants all users to stop using it. Why I think so: there is a website http://truecryptcheck.wordpress.com which contains all the hash sums for TrueCrypt 7.1a. Is has only 1 blog record from August 15, 2013, only for TrueCrypt and only for 7.1a. It's a bit strange to make a website with the hash sums for only one program and only one version of it. And another one thing: http://truecrypt.org.ua/news >April 12, 2014: Site is set to read-only mode. All the user accounts are deleted. Thanks everybody for participating in the project! **More assumptions here**: http://www.etcwiki.org/wiki/What_happened_to_Truecrypt_-_May_2014 -------------------------------- SourceForge sent emails on 22 May, they said they changed password algorithms and everybody should change their passwords. SourceForge claims everything is as usual (from https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7813121): >Providing some details from SourceForge: > >1. We have had no contact with the TrueCrypt project team (and thus no complaints). > >2. We see no indicator of account compromise; current usage is consistent with past usage. > >3. Our recent SourceForge forced password change was triggered by infrastructure improvements not a compromise. FMI see http://sourceforge.net/blog/forced-password-change/ > >Thank you, > >The SourceForge Team communityteam@sourceforge.net TrueCrypt developers are unknown and currently there is no way to know who is who and who should we listen to. From wikileaks twitter https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/471769936038461440: >(1/4) Truecrypt has released an update saying that it is insecure and development has been terminated http://truecrypt.sf.net > >(2/4) the style of the announcement is very odd; however we believe it is likely to be legitimate and not a simple defacement > >(3/4) the new executable contains the same message and is cryptographically signed.

Many people are suggesting NSA involvement, but there are many countries where you cannot freely develop and distribute crypto software. I live in such a country, and went digging on that basis ... So, we know that TrueCrypt is based on E4M (as claimed in TC sources and Usenet history). In 2000 the author of E4M was associated with a company operating from an address in South Africa (requires some Whois digging). That company merged with others to form SecurStar (at some point). E4M was discontinued in 2000 (Wikipedia). In 2002 South Africa passed the Electronic Communications and Transactions (ECT) Act, which required providers of crypto solutions to register with the government (with fines & jail time for not doing so). The author's involvement with SecurStar appeared to end in a legal spat around 2002 (Usenet). TC was released in Feb 2004, and shortly thereafter SecurStar made accusations of IP theft (Usenet, Wikipedia). Here's a not entirely implausible hypothesis: one or more of the original TC developers knew the E4M author personally, and at least one of the current developers still resides in South Africa. The developers have always concealed their identities in order to conceal their location, to avoid prosecution under the ECT Act. Said author(s) have now been discovered (or have new reason to fear discovery) by law enforcement, and are attempting to extricate themselves from the situation. This is of course pure speculation.","Twylite","9","2014-05-30 01:48:33"

Even if they pulled a lavabit for securities sake, they'd just shut down and pull the source(or wait for the audit results) instead of redirecting everyone to go counter to everything the program worked for.

Many people are suggesting NSA involvement, but there are many countries where you cannot freely develop and distribute crypto software. I live in such a country, and went digging on that basis ... So, we know that TrueCrypt is based on E4M (as claimed in TC sources and Usenet history). In 2000 the author of E4M was associated with a company operating from an address in South Africa (requires some Whois digging). That company merged with others to form SecurStar (at some point). E4M was discontinued in 2000 (Wikipedia). In 2002 South Africa passed the Electronic Communications and Transactions (ECT) Act, which required providers of crypto solutions to register with the government (with fines & jail time for not doing so). The author's involvement with SecurStar appeared to end in a legal spat around 2002 (Usenet). TC was released in Feb 2004, and shortly thereafter SecurStar made accusations of IP theft (Usenet, Wikipedia). Here's a not entirely implausible hypothesis: one or more of the original TC developers knew the E4M author personally, and at least one of the current developers still resides in South Africa. The developers have always concealed their identities in order to conceal their location, to avoid prosecution under the ECT Act. Said author(s) have now been discovered (or have new reason to fear discovery) by law enforcement, and are attempting to extricate themselves from the situation. This is of course pure speculation.","resurrectio","0","2014-05-30 20:10:46","It seems like 7.1a might have been the last release, supporting the notion that this is a hack with sketchy (trojan?) binaries.","xr1s","5","2014-05-29 03:37:48"

Dual_EC_DRBG is based on the [elliptic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve) [discrete logarithm problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm_problem) (ECDLP) and was for some time one of the four (now three) CSPRNGs standardized in [NIST SP 800-90A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST_SP_800-90A). >Sometime before its first known publication in 2004, a possible [backdoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_(computing\)) was discovered with the Dual_EC_DRBG's design, with the design of Dual_EC_DRBG having the unusual property that it was theoretically impossible for anyone but Dual_EC_DRBG's designers (NSA) to confirm the backdoor's existence. Doubts about Dual_EC_DRBG's security and performance had also been expressed even before it was standardized. [Bruce Schneier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Schneier) concluded shortly after standardization that the ""rather obvious"" backdoor (along with other deficiencies) would mean that nobody would use Dual_EC_DRBG. In 2013, New York Times reported that documents in their possession but never released to the public ""appear to confirm"" that the backdoor was real, and had been deliberately inserted by the [National Security Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency) as part of the NSA's [Bullrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullrun_(decryption_program\)) decryption program. The alleged backdoor would allow NSA to decrypt for example [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) encryption which used Dual_EC_DRBG as a CSPRNG. In December 2013, a Reuters news article alleged that in 2004, before NIST standardized Dual_EC_DRBG, NSA paid [RSA Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_Security) $10 million in a secret deal to use Dual_EC_DRBG as the default in the [RSA BSAFE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_BSAFE) cryptography library, which resulted in RSA Security becoming the most important distributor of the backdoored algorithm. RSA responded to this and subsequent media reports to ""categorically deny"" any insinuation that RSA had ever knowingly colluded with the NSA to incorporate a flaw in Dual_EC_DRBG, saying ""we have never kept [our] relationship [with the NSA] a secret"". >Members of the ANSI standard group, to which Dual_EC_DRBG was first submitted, were aware of the exact mechanism of the potential backdoor and how to disable it, but did not take sufficient steps to unconditionally disable the backdoor.

From that point on they may as well be dead. It is in the nation-state agency's best interest to not draw attention to TC. Removing all old binaries, compiling and uploading a new version with the encryption ripped out, and changing the site to warn the users doesn't make any sense. Ok so let us say that the agency forced them to do something (insert backdoor, whatever). If the agency was standing over their shoulders there is no way in hell they would let the TC devs throw this huge red flag up. Ok let us say the agency ruffed them up a bit and made severe threats forcing them to do something, and left (""we'll check back on you""). Maybe the TC devs actually complied while the men in dark hats and suits stood over their shoulders. At some point later the TC devs do all this weird shit to their project, guaranteeing to throw the community into chaos. Do you really think the agencyis just going to go ""oh well, we'll get the next app backdoored for sure""? No, because the TC devs are not known by anyone they are likely to be killed out of spite or to serve as an object lesson to the next unfortunate project to enter the agency's sights. OK, so as above except the TC devs have some sort of escape plan; they do not have to worry significantly about physical retaliation. *Then why not come forward*? The agency already knew where they lived and they fled. Either nuking the project the way that it happened or blowing the cover off the whole thing will end the same for the TC devs if they ever fall into the agency's hands again. None of these theories make much sense. If they were under pressure from a nation-state agency, surely their best defense would be publicity?

The second half is where you break anonymity: the browser leaks data (in this case via an IRC connection), which is used to open a port on their NAT box, which is further used to run an exploit on the NAT box to reveal a little more data, which is all finally tied back to Google maps to get the target's _physical location_ good to within about 100 meters.

Hell yeah! The amazing OpenBSD folks are hard at work on a fork of it ([LibreSSL](http://www.libressl.org/)). They're as ruthless as ever, just how it should be. Even OpenSSL is getting two extra developers, although I have relatively little faith in that effort. I don't see why a duplication of effort is truly necessary.

But they dont suggest the police were thwarted in a wiretap. They suggest past communications.. well if they they never saved them, it is meaningless if it was encrypted or not. and since they dont claim to have a locked box they cant crack... even with the lies, this doesnt support the legislation they want to implement. unless they got a time machine you cant decrypt something that doesnt exist anymore.

The suggestion is that we switch over to using a single government issued PKI keypair: - the public key, or more reasonably it's fingerprint, becomes our *unique identifier* - it lets us replace SSNs as a uniqueidentifier - and because So we come to - SSNs are bad, because it (along with birth certificate, drivers license, recent bill, etc) can prove identity - remove SSN as a mechanism to identify someone - we need *some* way to uniquely identify a person - suggestion is hash fingerprint of government issued public key - update all our systems: **Customers** | CustomerID | IdentityFingerprintSHA2 | |-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------| | {D3010F57-9148-421E-A4C8-79F0DB9A70B2} | [ee599907cdedf443](https://stackoverflow.com/a/573147/12597) | | {FDB8A9D2-18B4-49C8-8F88-AF816280204A} | ee599907cdedf443 | | {E82A1A51-C189-4C38-8AA9-49A871927EF0} | ee599907cdedf443 | - except that doesn't work - we need to have a unique ID - but people lose access to their private key - so they are issued new certificates - now their public key fingerprint changes - making their unique ID no longer unique Attempt#2 ----- So we come up with a new, unique **Singlular Stable Number** (SSN), in my encoding a 64-bit value with embedded authority and MAC. **Customers** | CustomerID | IdentityFingerprintSHA2 | SSN | |-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------| | {D3010F57-9148-421E-A4C8-79F0DB9A70B2} | ee599907cdedf443 | 16825-87987-44643-25192 | | {FDB8A9D2-18B4-49C8-8F88-AF816280204A} | cec1351a1575a95a | 16825-87987-44643-25192 | | {FDB8A9D2-18B4-49C8-8F88-AF816280204A} | a855c7bfebaae892 | 16825-87987-44643-25192 | | {FDB8A9D2-18B4-49C8-8F88-AF816280204A} | ee599907cdedf443 | 16825-87987-44643-25192 | | {E82A1A51-C189-4C38-8AA9-49A871927EF0} | a855c7bfebaae892 | 16825-87987-44643-25192 | So that works great; except we haven't done anything: - **Before**: SSN - **After**: SSN People are upset over the EquiFax breach because it exposed people's SSNs. In our new system, that would not have been solved, we still would have exposed people's SSNs to the world. Nothing was *solved*. But it's not the SSN itself that anyone cares about --------------------------------------------- The problem is *identity verification*. For many places: - if you **have** someone's SSN - you can then impersonate them The concern over the EquiFax leak isn't that my SSN is out there. The concern is that people can use an SSN for impersonation. So we're no longer in a world where we're trying to get rid of SSNs. Getting rid of SSNs is not possible; but that's ok because it's not the problem. The problem is that people can use an SSN to prove identity. This is where cryptography comes in. I am issued a public-private key pair. Everyone knows my public key, and everyone is *allowed* to know my public key. The nice feature comes in when i use the corresponding private key (*""that only i know""*) to show that i am me. In the RSA system: - i encrypt something with my private key - you decrypt it with my public key - that shows that i must be in possession of the private key - therefore you trust that i am me This systems starts to fall apart in two ways: - Private key breach: i encrypt something with your private key, i can now impersonate you If my private key is breached, we are back to having a secret value that needs to be kept protected. And if it's not: people can steal my identity. So we must revoke that key-pair, and i need to be issued a new key-pair. The situations where i need to have a new key-pair issued: - i've lost access to my key: i cannot prove who i am - my key has been stolen: you cannot trust any proof i provide So now i need to present some paperwork; a SSN, a driver's license, a birth certificate, copy of old records, etc, and i get a new key. We've come full circle back to where we are today: social engineering to get an identity. And we come to the other way the system falls apart: - identity theft during key regeneration: i claim to need a new key and gain your identity Even better is the fact that if someone claimed to be me needing a new key, and they revoke my current valid key, i suddenly lose any ability to prove myself.

If you are ~~paranoid~~ concerned you can somewhat protect against this with DNSSEC (server + client side) or certificate pinnging (client side, something like Certificate Patrol). Agencies can also obtain the actual private keys as used by the services themselves. This is almost impossible to detect for the client. Some changes in latency maybe, if anything.

In the case of a compromised CA (allowing them to mint certs for any domain) the cost of discovery is expensive: the entire CA is burned (c.f., DigiNotar). They're not going to use this tactic wholesale, as the risk of being caught carries too high a cost. On the other hand, capturing certs for individual sites is necessarily more difficult because they must compromise *every* site they want to MITM. This is less expensive when they get caught, but way more expensive upfront. Long story short, this sort of thing is only likely to happen against *specific* targets. Not for wholesale data collection.","hackingdreams","1","2015-01-13 08:46:24","Also, would this set a precedent for the US to try this?

A server certificate is ""valid"" if it: 1. Is within the prescribed validity period. 2. Has the same Common Name as the host you're attempting to access. 3. Is signed by a trusted signing certificate (Certificate Authority). States can and have obtained signing keys for trusted CAs. Therefore, they can generate a new and valid certificate for ANY host. The client would not detect this attack unless he or she was keeping track of the certificate fingerprints in use (certificate pinning), or if the chain of trust had changed. Hint: Almost no one does this.

Later, with a warrant, the government can use their private key to decrypt your whole message. But wait, how do they know which public key to use? A unique id?

In both cases America passed laws (banning drugs, banning financial privacy) and the entire world fell in line. You have to realize that the purpose of these laws isn't to stop people from doing something. The war on drugs doesn't stop people from using drugs. It just gives the government one more excuse to imprison their perceived enemies. For example, in America, supposedly millions of people are in prison because of drug use, but the real reason they're in prison is because they're black. The drug thing is just an excuse. With the encryption ban, you'll see people imprisoned for encryption, but the real reason they're in prison will be their political beliefs. You'll see uneven enforcement (those who are politically supportive of the regime will get a slap on the wrist, those who are against will get severe sentences).

Law enforcement in a paragraph. The FBI, Police, etc... aren't just looking for the bad guys. They're also managing the act of violence. One reason the FBI and police tends to be despised among ethnics for example is partly due to their ""brush fire"" approach in law enforcement, also their specific targeting of minorities. In the brush fire approach they will intentionally catalyze violence/crime in the goal of preventing ""crime from spreading"" to ""white neighborhoods"". LA riots is one example. Their main purpose is to protect wealthy white men, and if that comes at the cost of security for everyone else that's what they will do. It makes it easier to manage their goals when the predatory people target weaker prey so they can focus on protecting white neighborhoods. That's how they work in a nutshell, and why they are pursuing weaker encryption. Weakening encryption is like giving people weak locks that criminals can break so that the criminals will target their ""undesirables"". Just one of their little nasty tricks.

There is no getting around that fact. So issue a key per transaction, do whatever you want. No system will ever be able to tell if the person unlocking it is up to no go. The other problem, that really relates to your answer, is that there is no just recourse for leaked keys. You can sue the government and in most cases they will say go away and that is the end of it. To be truly made whole again, the government would need to undo whatever damage was done. If you don't want personal information leaked, then they would need to undo the leak. Remember the old internet saying ""What has been seen cannot be unseen."" Personally, I think if the Government is going to screw things up, we might as well get some better checks and balances in there. Every politician that signs the bill that eventually goes into law now becomes an accomplice to any crimes committed due to their retarding of personal security.

Sure, you're just stating, ""A system of government with spying capabilities and warrants needs checks and balances."" That's what we have today. You can sit on the side of the argument that says, ""The US government does good enough,"" ""The US government does okay, but should do better,"" or maybe, ""I don't trust the US government at all."" I can't do much to assuage your fears if you're in the last camp. And remember, *I do not advocate these laws.* I think the government has *plenty* of opportunities to gather information, without requiring encryption to be *fundamentally broken.* But I think it's interesting to have a conversation, ""Okay, if we're going to fundamentally break encryption, how can we do it in the **least bad way?**"" > The other problem, that really relates to your answer, is that there is no just recourse for leaked keys. There's no just recourse for the government revealing *anything* about you. Your SSN, your credit card numbers, your sexual preferences, your sealed juvenile arrest record, your HIV status, any of it. Yet the government *currently has that information* and *leaks do happen.* Why do I bring this up in response? Because I'm not inventing some entirely unheard of database. The government *currently* does this kind of stuff. > Personally, I think if the Government is going to screw things up, we might as well get some better checks and balances in there.

I agree with this comment. We need to find the least bad way possible. Right now we have a way (do not disclose your key to anyone. Not your mother, your priest, your state representative or the police.) so I feel the argument really should be reworded to ""How can we do it **worse than we do currently**, but not the worst possible way."" At least at that point we aren't lying to ourselves since we *are* making the situation worse. >There's no just recourse for the government revealing anything about you. The major difference between leaked SSN, or CC or whatever the government knows about and breaking crypto is that these other situations are already flawed. The fact that the Government has an ID number for each person that they invented, and created their own ""security"" to keep safe means that the system was broken at inception. Right now we have some pretty darn good crypto that is very difficult to break. If we had no encryption and someone came up with the idea that we should have encryption then I'd agree with your comment but as they currently stand its apples and oranges. > The government currently does this kind of stuff. For the most part a lot of these databases are anonymous. If its for statistics, health issues, public planning...its more about the numbers than the individual. Sure they invented SSN but honestly the fact that we allow banks to send CC offers in the mail, non-certified I'd be amazed if it wasn't impossible to open a line of credit for someone without their SSN. Yeah someone could get your medical records but I'm sure I can get a lot of info about you just by following you around, seeing where you eat, shop, work and if you don't know who I am, you wouldn't be suspicious. We sit in a waiting room for 30 mins before the doctor shows up. How easy would it be to plant a bug during that time. (I'm not a crazy person, just saying its easy). > > Every politician that signs the bill that eventually goes into law now becomes an accomplice to any crimes committed due to their retarding of personal security. > ...your personal security was harmed as soon as you were given an SSN. If someone uses your SSN to steal your identity, are we really going to hold the government responsible for inventing SSNs? Again, broken system from the start. Yeah I think its a ridiculous system and it should be fixed, but its not breaking something that currently exists that is much more secure. We are telling this officials today that they will be causing more problems, and yet they won't listen. Accessory Before The Fact Definition A person who aids, abets, or encourages another to commit a crime but who is not present at the scene. An accessory before the fact, like an accomplice, may be held criminally liable to the same extent as the principal. Many jurisdictions refer to an accessory before the fact as an accomplice. -- From the Cornell Law website They even have a name for what these people are doing. They **know** it will cause problems and yet they continue to do it. > What do you think should happen if SSN databases get leaked? Not enough. If its gross misconduct by someone I find it appalling that the only thing that happens is someone ""steps down"" from their job. Now that we have a very specific situation, where all the experts are saying will not work, I feel sick to my stomach knowing that the people running this country are going to intentionally screw things up. It is completely ridiculous and they should feel ashamed of themselves. >Playing the devil's advocate, if the government willingly prevents itself from gathering evidence against people who are planning crimes, or evidence against the associates of people who already did commit crimes, aren't they equally damned? No. There is no absolute necessity for a government to exist. While we do gain benefits by working together as a whole, it is not imperative for human survival. In a world where no government existed we would all have to rely on each other for support, or be allowed to live our lives alone without any arbitrary requirements by others (like the government currently poses). In this same world your personal safety is your responsibility and yours to relinquish to someone else if you so choose. In this government-less world I can protect my secrets by using Math. The government is here to take that away from us. In the extreme I can **be law abiding** and still stay safe by moving to the middle of nowhere, staying away from large populations, airports and trains and buses, etc. (Yes I know this is extreme, but totally possible **and** legal). The government is making it illegal for me to keep my secrets personal. I don't like this conversation either, but personally I feel it is the only one left to be had. When we can't talk to these people about absolute truths (having a key doesn't automatically make you a good guy), then really what is there to talk about? I think having the conversation at least keeps our first amendment rights working. I see this conversation as a Public Discussion ""Canary."" Once we start seeing the ability to talk about this stuff be repressed then we know the end is near.","VikingCoder","1","2016-04-15 22:13:59","I'll just make the app use two sets of keys, one for government and one for the actual data, the government key will mostly encrypt stuff from /dev/urandom ","cheaphomemadeacid","2","2016-04-15 23:10:47"

Remember, I'm *on your side.* I'm arguing the devil's advocate position. Which goes, ""Yes, it weakens encryption, but we can compromise and make REASONABLE considerations for the government.""

It is completely ridiculous and they should feel ashamed of themselves. Remember, I'm on your side. I think the government has plenty of other means to gather evidence. But let's pretend for a minute that I *don't* think they have enough means to gather evidence. A court has issued a warrant to gather information. You and I can debate whether courts do enough to guarantee a warrant is warranted. But it's a GOOD PROCESS. It's the best check and balance I can come up with. Can you come up with a better one? Probably not, right? So, pretend I think some bad guys are going to get away with horrific crimes, because even with a warrant, they can't get the evidence they need. You honestly still think they should ""feel ashamed of themselves""? Come on. It's possible to have good intensions, and be in favor of government back-doors. > There is no absolute necessity for a government to exist. Bullshit. Warlords stealing cows and raping children is what you get. Slavery based on race. Indentured servitude. Debtors prisons. Extortion. Black mail. Ponzi schemes. PERIOD. That is what you get.

Even though those things were invented before the laws were written. >You don't get to grandfather something in just because of chronology. There is 0 situations where weapons are used for non-harm. Cryptography is overwhelmingly about stopping harm. I'm not saying you grandfather something in due to chronology, I'm saying that this situation is the complete opposite of the weapons (and other harmful things) conversation which typically comes up. Every single person in this country uses cryptography every single day. If we stopped everything nuclear, power plants and bomb making, then we'd have the same planet but with a bunch more solar and wind power and more oil wells. Every day life would be about the same. If we weaken crypto then a trip to the local grocery store might cost you your livelihood. >That's not remotely true. IRS has everything. The VA has everything on anyone going through VA hospitals. The military has everything on every veteran or soldier. The police have everything on every arrest. Hell, you're supposed to update the government about your address for the DRAFT. Yes you're right. I would hope that the two places the US government would not skimp on security would be the IRS and the Military. Then again, our government does a lot of stupid things so I really wouldn't put it past them. I was just pointing out that a lot of the low hanging fruit tends to be semi-useless information. > > I'm sure I can get a lot of info about you just by following you around > You're changing gears too rapidly. Sorry. I just wanted to point out that personal information gathering is so simple from so many other avenues, that worrying about already flawed systems shouldn't be a huge part of the argument. The current setup sucks, really bad. But seeing as we really aren't going to be able to stop the Government from implementing a law that we all want stopped...is there really even a chance we could convince them to fix broken systems? But I guess, weakest link and all... >I'm just debating for the devil's advocate here. Thank you, its a good side to exercise. >You tried to say ""the government can't be trusted with this information."" I'm saying ""lots of other information rises to this same level of damage, and we currently DO trust the government with it."" I'm defending the assertion that this data is not that different from other data we let the government handle. I don't trust the government with this information. And I didn't _entrust_ them with it either. This situation was imposed on me by my parents, and their parents, and their parents...etc. There is a lot of things the government does wrong that I have no choice over. I know we all can vote, but this crypto issue is a huge issue for me. I've contacted all sorts of representatives and all I get back is a form email/letter. I plan to vote out every single person I can that goes against this view...but that won't do much as I'm really contending against people's ""fears"" than rational thought. > And you know that not gathering this information will allow people to go without being prosecuted for crimes. This is not because of cryptography, it will be because Police/FBI/CIA/etc wouldn't be using **every other means of investigation they have had for years**. Lets require a little bit of foot work here. Follow some people and gather some evidence. Or we (really they) can complain about how everyone is ""going dark."" > A government is compromise. The problem is that it really isn't. When it comes down to it, you and I have no real say in anything. We aren't rich, we aren't famous, we aren't loud enough and don't carry a big enough sword. Common sense and reasoning are fighting against Political Powers which solely exist on top of fear, confusion and stupidity. We have so many people that vote party line, some many more vote for religious reasons. The news media wants spin to make money, and the wealthy want to keep those in power who help them make more money. So no, government is not a compromise, its something that is forced on us. Give me safe borders from foreign attack, a centralized currency and an interstate highway system and if you can stop there then maybe we are getting close to something that isn't imposing. > Wire-tapping is just as problematic. If AT&T builds wire-tapping capabilities into their phone system, etc. With crypto...we can negate the wire tapping :) > make REASONABLE considerations for the government... > ...But it's a GOOD PROCESS. It's the best check and balance I can come up with. Can you come up with a better one? Probably not, right? This is where I take the biggest issue. (And yes I know, devil's advocate). I think part of what would make me consider it to be reasonable is to put in a better deterrent from prying into your life, that would made law enforcement question whether they should do it. Right now if they have probable cause, the police can tell a judge and get a warrant and start going through your life. Lets say you are completely innocent, they really had no reason to look at you other than you look like the guy they suspect. What happens when they figure out they screwed up? If you are lucky they apologize. In most cases they tell you that is a necessary evil of having such a ""wonderful legal system."" I think there should be direct consequences for these actions. Sure you can sue the government but there are so many protections that unless the police were just being completely negligent there is nothing we can do. This is wrong. You should be willing to stack your livelihood on the fact that you may cause someone irreparable harm. Maybe that means many criminals go free but the thought of someone's life being destroyed because law enforcement wasn't held accountable is saddening. Yes, being locked up is far worse, but exposing personal, private matters can be quite as damaging. >You honestly still think they should ""feel ashamed of themselves""? > Come on. It's possible to have good intensions, and be in favor of government back-doors. Yes you can have good intentions. And when someone tells you it won't work, it will cause more harm than good, you should sit back and think, ""I'm being told by people much more informed than I, that this is a bad idea. I should probably no longer pursue it."" Rather than any of these bills getting better, they tend to get worse and more secretive. SOPA, PIPA, CISPA....people didn't like them and eventually the way the debate ended and a law was passed was to have the government be as quiet as possible so most people stopped thinking about it, and to ware down those who were still adamant to stop the law. Honestly I could see this bill getting tossed, maybe one or two more and eventually it will be a rider on some random bill no one cares about and no one reads and that will be the end of personal privacy. >Bullshit. Warlords stealing cows and raping children is what you get. Slavery based on race. Indentured servitude. Debtors prisons. Extortion. Black mail. Ponzi schemes. PERIOD. That is what you get. > Also, you get conquered by your neighbor who has a government and an organized military. We can all unite while still keeping ourselves free from a governing body. I know it wouldn't happen and we _need_ government but that's more about the flaw of man than anything else. We have gotten to the point where our government really does act like a sentient, self serving entity. I'm not for getting rid of the government. I just feel that this whole concept of ""we need to provide support for what the government needs so it can protect us"" is kind of BS. Most of the laws that government were created by people with a completely different view on life as myself (and many people of this era). A huge portion of my interaction with government is...not anything I would have voted for. I don't want to pay SS because I think it is a pyramid scheme. I think people should rely on their friends and family for support rather than on others. If everyone needs resources they should all pitch in equally. Yes I would rather have the US government asking for these sacrifices from me than many other governments. The problem I'm having is (and maybe this is a generational thing) that's all I see lately. 3-4 hours of my day go to paying other people and I know when my day comes no one will be doing the same for me. I pay crazy amounts for healthcare because others can't or wont pay. My retirement is shot because banks were greedy and my elected officials did nothing. I can't vote for someone who actually agrees with my view because you have to be rich to run, and they are all nut jobs. And now I'm being told that due to terrorists ""going dark"" with their clear text sms?!?! that now I also have to worry about the fact that I can't keep a secret?!?! I'll make the sacrifice as long as I know that those asking me to do so will also make a sacrifice for me. Oh wait, I want them to be held accountable if their decisions make my life worse? That's crazy talk. I'm glad people are talking, and I'm glad there are people willing to take the other side. Personally this is one of those issues I just cannot get behind the other side, not even enough to have a debate.","VikingCoder","1","2016-04-15 22:13:59","I'll just make the app use two sets of keys, one for government and one for the actual data, the government key will mostly encrypt stuff from /dev/urandom ","cheaphomemadeacid","2","2016-04-15 23:10:47"

""trip to the local grocery store might cost you your livelihood"" isn't a good way to convince people. It's not. I don't like using hyperbole but I think the whole weapons argument its such a Free Pass type of argument. Weapons are about hurting people, maliciously or in self defense. This country has strayed so far away from ""A well regulated Militia"" that unless you are talking about hunting for purely food, its all about death. So really what is the right argument against that? Some people say we need weapons and won't agree, even though it **is** about killing people, right or wrong. So yes, we aren't in some crazy world were there is a guy under every cash register waiting to read your CC number, but the fact that some people want to equate this crypto issue with weapons means you really have to either not respond or make just as crazy of a response.

We find out that people ""stole money"" from US citizens by not paying taxes and they get a slap on the wrist and forced to pay back the taxes they owed. Why would this situation be any different? > boarders ... currency ... highways Yes its all a compromise and yes some people will say that's not enough. We are heading in the opposite direction of less government and more personal freedoms. That's all I was getting at. I like having snow plows in the winter and state parks to go to. I just wish we were moving towards less government rather than more. >More like the judge screwed up. > And again, the fourth estate HAS FAILED. We should all be reading about how our judges are failing us. True its more their issue. All in all we are a lot better than many countries. I just feel like as a whole the biggest problems we face is that people don't take pride in what they do or responsibility for their actions. I know some of my argument is more about frustration... > You skipped all the way past the DA bringing a case against you. That was a pretty important check and balance you breezed through. Things cannot be unseen. As an example...My wife and I like to do some crazy stuff in bed, where no one can see us. Our neighbor does something stupid, they investigate me, look on my computer...whoa baby. But then the cops figure out it wasn't me. Some time later I have a job that somehow negatively affects one of those police officers. I run a bank, he can't pay his bills and ""I"" take his house. He decides to announce to the world that I like some crazy stuff. My company has a morals clause and I get fired. The problem is that our Government allowed this to occur and its just collateral damage from the war on whatever is pushing this crypto stuff. We have checks and balances but if we can't expect our laws to keep up with technology, I don't see how we can expect our government to actually stop things from happening. > > Honestly I could see this bill getting tossed, maybe one or two more and eventually it will be a rider on some random bill no one cares about and no one reads and that will be the end of personal privacy. > Hyperbole. Really?!?! Obama care was passed when many representatives stated they didn't read it. TARP had so many riders for sooooooo many strange things not related to finances. I think there is a solid track record as of late that would consider a few failed bills and a rider to be the true ending to ""I'm just a Bill on Capitol Hill"". > Government...People... I'm all for assembling to resolve issues. But when a government can exist, do absolutely nothing while sitting in gridlock for no good reason then it ceases to be useful. > Children should pitch in equally? Women and children first right? lol. No we should be reasonable with this type of situation but I don't think we need to go as overboard as we have. We have politicians that are lifers, we have FBI/CIA/NSA that are lifers. There is no competition and there for no reason for them to do the right thing. When these people take on too much control for too long, this is when government becomes an ""entity."" It really is _their_ ideals that get pushed, rather than whats best for all. > The math says otherwise. Healthcare would be cheaper under single-payer We have safety nets for everything but the fact that right in the thick of things means that I don't quality for support and I can't legally say to a doctor ""sorry your diagnosis was 'we aren't really sure what you have' so I'm not paying you."" But I think my rant was getting a little off topic. > Hahaha - I'm sorry, I've gotta laugh at you... You're all ""personal responsibility!"" until you made a bad bet. I could have put my money under a mattress but then I'd never retire either. And its more about all the damage that occurred. And when is investing not being responsible? Yes its my money to lose, but I'm also not expecting a handout when I get old. Its my bed and I'll lay in it. Just tired of seeing other people do shitty things and no consequence and when I just want to keep my naughty fun time with my wife secret on my phone...then I'm the villain >:) >I'm for single-payer political campaigns. We're NUTS that we don't demand our politicians take public money, and ONLY public money. Our greed is killing us. We are in agreement here. > You never could. I mean, really - you never could. We're just debating how easy / how hard that information should be to gather and use. But I could try. Yes I know...big wrench. It was up to me to decide if my naughty pics were worth two wallops or three. I always assumed the one hitting me with the wrench was a bad guy. Turns out its my own government. I have the right to Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness...as long as being happy also means allowing the government in when they tell you. I guess I should just keep all my secrets in my head.

I wonder if they don't understand the cat is already out of the bag, and has been for a while. If you get a backdoor into every security and crypto product in the world, the specs for pretty much all interesting and useful algorithms and protocols is published out in the world right now. Never mind existing open source code to implement them. I literally implemented a small suite of popular crypto algorithms when I was 17, just for fun. You don't need to be a rocket scientist or accomplished mathematician to do this stuff. The tools are out there and the ""bad guys"" will use them if they can't use the ""good"" security services. The only way I can see this being effective is a) short-term maybe it catches some dumb ""bad guys"" (remember that some of them don't even use encryption and see how effective we are at catching them, so I'm not optimistic there), or b) if long-term this sentiment is drastically expanded as a draconian hammer and it is impossible to run your own code on devices (eg, there are no open platforms). The latter is necessary to make this kind of approach actually work and I'm afraid at some point a politician will realize that.","smileybone","4","2015-12-01 11:15:23","Coworker reminded me of this article: http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/260522-paris-revives-battle-over-data-encryption","mgerwitz","2","2015-12-01 02:13:19"

Authentication is done by signing certificates with known keys (and then those certificates signing other keys) until you get the certificate for the key of the person/server you're interacting with. That's accomplished by a hashing algorithm (SHA-2) and a signature algorithm (DSA), and some way to generate secure random numbers. You can't directly encrypt anything with either of those algorithms. Integrity protection uses the same two things. At best, you could turn SHA-2 into a stream cipher but you'd have to have some kind of shared secret.","redsteakraw","0","2015-12-01 05:11:08","Honestly, how exactly do you stop encrypting your communications?
